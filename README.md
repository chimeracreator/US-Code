This is an attempt to track the United States Code (USC) using Git.

The US Code is defined as, "The United States Code is a consolidation and codification by subject matter of the general and permanent laws of the United States."
This does not comprise all of the federal laws in the United States and it contains no state laws.
However, I thought it might be interesting to load into Git so here it is.

This repository was made using a Python script, which may be uploaded in the future.
All sentences in the files end in line breaks in order to make it easier to compare changes to individual laws.
The US Code is prepared by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel of the United States House of Representatives.
