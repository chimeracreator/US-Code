In subsection (a), the words “whether under temporary or permanent appointment” are omitted as surplusage.
The words “the following pay grades” are substituted for the words “the various pay grades prescribed for commissioned officers by subsection (a) of this section, as follows”. The words “(other than a commissioned warrant officer)” are inserted to conform to the definition of “warrant officer” in section 101(13) of this revised title.

In subsection (b), the words “with two or less years of service computed under section 205 of this title” are substituted for the word “minimum”.

In subsections (c) and (e), the words “with two or less years of service computed under section 205 of this title” are substituted for the words “with under two cumulative years’ service” and “with under two cumulative years of service”, in sections 308 and 232(e), respectively, of existing title 37.

In subsection (e), the words “enlisted or appointed under the Army Aviation Cadet Act, as amended, or under the Naval Aviation Cadet Act of 1942, as amended” are omitted as obsolete and surplusage.
Both of the cited acts were repealed by section 53 of the Act of August 10, 1956, ch. 1041 (70A Stat. 641), and replaced by various sections of title 10. Further reference is surplusage, however, since aviation cadets are not appointed or enlisted under any provision of law other than the sections of title 10 embodying the former Army Aviation Cadet Act and the Naval Aviation Cadet Act of 1942. The word “basic” is inserted for clarity, since the word “pay” as defined in section 101(21) of this revised title includes special and incentive pays.
Incentive pay for aviation cadets is provided in section 301(b) of this revised title.

In subsection (f), the words “While on active duty”, in section 6915(f) of title 10 and section 758a(f) of title 14, are omitted as covered by section 204 of this title which prescribes the conditions under which members of the uniformed services are entitled to basic pay.
The words “Unless he is entitled to the basic pay of a higher pay grade” are substituted for the words “or that of his grade, whichever is greater” in section 6915(f) of title 10 and section 758a(f) of title 14.

In subsection (g), the words “Except as provided by subsections (e) and (f)” are inserted to reflect those subsections relating to enlisted aviation cadets or aviation pilots.

The Secretary concerned may extend such period in any case if the Secretary determines that it is in the interests of fairness and equity to do so.

(3) A member is not entitled to benefits under subsection (g) or (h) if the injury, illness, disease, or aggravation of an injury, illness, or disease is the result of the gross negligence or misconduct of the member.

(4) Regulations with respect to procedures for paying pay and allowances under subsections (g) and (h) shall be prescribed—

(A) by the Secretary of Defense for the armed forces under the jurisdiction of the Secretary; and

(B) by the Secretary of Transportation for the Coast Guard when the Coast Guard is not operating as a service in the Navy.

[The citations to section 232(d) of existing title 37, above, are to the language of subsection (d) set forth in the codification note under section 232, rather than that erroneously set forth in the text of the section.]

In subsection (a), the last 27 words are substituted for the words “or performance of the duties provided for by sections 5, 81, 94, 97 and 99 of the National Defense Act, as amended,” to reflect the current citations.
So much of the introductory clause as follows the exception is substituted for the 36 words preceding 1st proviso of 1st sentence of section 232(d) of existing title 37. The words “on the active list” are omitted as covered by the words “active duty” as defined in section 101(18) of this revised title.
The words “(provided for or authorized in the National Defense Act, as amended, or in the Naval Reserve Act of 1938, as amended)” are omitted as covered by the words “provided by law”.

In subsection (b), the words “For the purposes of subsection (a)” are inserted for clarity.
The words “active duty for a period of more than 30 days” are substituted for the words “extended active duty in excess of thirty days”. The words “call or” are inserted to conform to the words “called or”.

In subsection (c), the words “and allowances” are omitted, since, under chapter 7 of this revised title, entitlement to allowances depends upon entitlement to basic pay.
The last sentence is substituted for the last 38 words of the 2d proviso of the 1st sentence of section 232(d) of existing title 37.

In subsection (d), the words “for the purposes of this section” are substituted for the words “and which entitles them to receive basic pay . . . in the service of the United States”. The words “pursuant to this section” are omitted as surplusage.

In subsection (e), the words “or active duty for training” are omitted as covered by the words “active duty” as defined in section 101(18) of this revised title.

In subsection (f), the words “is appointed” are substituted for the words “has been or may be commissioned”. The words “under the laws appointing such graduates to the Army” and the last 16 words of section 308a of existing title 37 are omitted as surplusage.
The words “to the date of his acceptance of and qualification under his commission” are omitted, since the member concerned would continue to be entitled to basic pay after that acceptance and qualification.
The words “or the United States Naval Academy” are inserted to reflect section 541 of title 10, under which graduates of that Academy may be appointed in the Army or the Air Force.

In subsection (i), the inclusion of the Coast Guard Reserve is based on the authority contained in section 755(c) of title 14.

In clause (2)(F), the words “a reserve component of a uniformed service” are substituted for the words “the National Guard of the United States, or in the Organized Reserve Corps, or in the Officers’ Reserve Corps, or in the Enlisted Reserve Corps, or in the Medical Reserve Corps, or in the Medical Reserve Corps of the Navy, or in the Dental Reserve Corps of the Navy . . . or in the Naval Reserve . . .or in the Air National Guard of the United States, or in the Air Force Reserve, or in the officers’ section of the Air Force Reserve, or in the enlisted section of the Air Force Reserve, or in the Air Corps Reserve . . . or in the Marine Corps Reserve, or in the Coast Guard Reserve, or in the Reserve Corps of the Public Health Service,” since all of the named organizations were or are reserve components.
In clause (4), the words “as it existed at any time before April 16, 1947” are inserted for clarity, since the reference is intended to apply to the corps established by law before April 16, 1947. Service in the Army Nurse Corps or Navy Nurse Corps now existing would be included under clause (1) or (2), since there is now no legal distinction between the service of nurses and that of other members of the Army and Navy.
In clause (6), the date “January 1, 1961,” is substituted for the words “the effective date of this section,” to reflect laws enacted after that effective date which authorized certain service to be credited for pay purposes.
See, for example, Public Law 86–142. Clause (9) is substituted for section 233(b) (less proviso) of existing title 37. The last sentence is substituted for section 233(b) (proviso) of existing title 37.

In subsection (b), the first 33 words of section 233(d) of existing title 37 are omitted as covered by the words “are computed by adding” in subsection (a). The words “for any reason,” in section 233(d) of existing title 37, are omitted as surplusage.

In subsection (c)(3), the words “chapter 67 of title 10” are substituted for the words “title III of the Army and Air Force Vitalization and Retirement Equalization Act of 1948,” since that title was repealed by section 53 of the Act of August 10, 1956, ch. 1041 (70A Stat. 641), and is now codified as chapter 67 of title 10 by section 1 of that Act.

Benefits Not To Accrue for Periods Prior to September 23, 1996

No increase in pay or retired or retainer pay to accrue for periods before Sept. 23, 1996, by reason of amendments made by section 507 of Pub. L. 104–201, see section 507(c) of Pub. L. 104–201, set out as a note under section 2106 of Title 10, Armed Forces.

In subsection (a), the words “National Guard” are substituted for the words “National Guard, Air National Guard”, in section 301(a) of existing title 37, to conform to the definition of “National Guard” in section 101(6) of this revised title.
The words “member of a reserve component of a uniformed service” are substituted for the words “National Guard of the United States, Air National Guard of the United States, Organized Reserve Corps, Naval Reserve, Air Force Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve, Coast Guard Reserve, and the Reserve Corps of the Public Health Service,” since all of those organizations, or their successors, are the reserve components of the uniformed services.
The words “who is not entitled to basic pay under section 204 of this title” are substituted for section 301(e) as (applicable to basic pay) of existing title 37. The words “of a corresponding grade” are inserted for clarity.

In subsection (b), the words “National Guard or reserve components” are substituted for the listing of organizations for the reasons set forth above.
Reference to “classes of organization,” so far as they relate to the National Guard, are omitted, since there are no classes of organization of the National Guard.

(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the years of service of a member as an air weapons controller shall be computed, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, from the date the member begins training leading to a designation as an air weapons controller, but there shall be excluded from such computation any period of more than 90 days during which the member performs primary duties other than as an air weapons controller.

(d) In time of war, the President may suspend the payment of incentive pay for any hazardous duty described in subsection (a).

(e) A member is entitled to not more than two payments of incentive pay, authorized by this section, for a period of time during which he qualifies for more than one payment of that pay.

(f)(1) Under regulations prescribed by the President and to the extent provided for by appropriations, when a member of a reserve component of a uniformed service, or of the National Guard, who is entitled to compensation under section 206 of this title, performs, under orders, any duty described in subsection (a) for members entitled to basic pay, he is entitled to an increase in compensation equal to 1/30 of the monthly incentive pay authorized by subsection (b) or (c), as the case may be, for the performance of that hazardous duty by a member of a corresponding grade who is entitled to basic pay.
He is entitled to the increase for as long as he is qualified for it, for each regular period of instruction, or period of appropriate duty, at which he is engaged for at least two hours, including that performed on a Sunday or holiday, or for the performance of such other equivalent training, instruction, duty, or appropriate duties, as the Secretary may prescribe under section 206(a) of this title.
This subsection does not apply to a member who is entitled to basic pay under section 204 of this title for the entire month.

(2)(A) If in any calendar month a member performs duty as described in paragraph (1) and while entitled to basic pay also performs hazardous duty as described in the same clause of subsection (a) as constitutes the predicate for his entitlement under paragraph (1), the earned units of measuring entitlement for incentive pay under this section shall be combined.
If the sum of units determined under the preceding sentence equals or exceeds the minimum standard prescribed by the President for entitlement to pay specified under subsections (b) and (c) for a member of corresponding grade who is entitled to basic pay for the entire relevant month, the member shall be entitled to an increase in compensation equal to 1/30 of the monthly incentive pay authorized by subsection (b) or (c) for the performance of that hazardous duty by a member of corresponding grade who is entitled to basic pay for the entire month.

(B) A member who qualifies for entitlement under this paragraph is entitled to the increase for each day in the relevant month in which he is entitled to basic pay pursuant to section 204 of this title or to compensation under section 206 of this title.

(C) In this paragraph, the term,1 “units” means the significant increments of performance prescribed as qualifying standards in regulations promulgated by the President pursuant to this section.

In subsection (a), the words “is also entitled” are substituted for the words “shall, in addition thereto, be entitled”. The words “For the purposes of this subsection” are inserted for clarity.
The word “competent” is omitted as surplusage.

In subsection (b), the words preceding the tables are substituted for section 235(b) (words preceding tables) of existing title 37. The words “Years of service computed under section 205” are inserted in the tables for clarity.

In subsection (f), the words “a member of a reserve component of a uniformed service, or of the National Guard” are substituted for the enumeration of the organizations concerned in section 301(d) of existing title 37. The words “when . . . performs, under orders, any duty described in subsection (a)(1)–(11) for members entitled to basic pay” are substituted for the words “when required by competent orders to perform any hazardous duty prescribed by or pursuant to section 235 of this title for members of the uniformed services entitled to receive basic pay and when in consequence of such orders they do perform any hazardous duty so prescribed”. The last sentence is substituted for section 301(e) (as applicable to (d)) of existing title 37.

In subsection (g), the words “entitled to incentive pay under section 301(a)(1) of this title” are substituted for the words “flight pay”. At the time of the enactment of the source statute, additional pay was authorized as “flight pay”. However, the Career Compensation Act of 1949 did not authorize “flight pay” but provided incentive pay in section 204(a)(1) [now section 301(a)(1) of this revised title] for “duty as a crew member . . . involving frequent and regular participation in aerial flight”. The words “before January 2 of each year” are substituted for the words “On or before January 1, annually”. The word “grade” is substituted for the word “rank” to conform to the definition in section 101(15) of this revised title.

Persons Entitled To Receive Incentive Pay for Duty Involving Contact With Persons Afflicted With Leprosy

Section 624(b) of Pub. L. 98–525 provided that: “A member of the uniformed services who is entitled on the day before the date of the enactment of this Act [Oct. 19, 1984] to receive incentive pay under section 301(a)(5) [subsec. (a)(5) of this section] (for the performance of duty involving intimate contact with persons afflicted with leprosy) shall continue to be entitled to such pay under such section as in effect on that day so long as the member continues (without a break) to be assigned to perform such duties on and after that day.”

By virtue of the authority vested in me by sections 301(a) and (f), 305(a), 402(f), and 403(g) of title 37 of the United States Code, and as President of the United States and Commander in Chief of the armed forces of the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:

Part I—Incentive Pay for Hazardous Duty

Sec. 101. For the purposes of these regulations:

(a) The term “aerial flight” shall be construed to mean flight in an aircraft, glider, or spacecraft; and a flight shall be deemed to begin when the aircraft, glider, or spacecraft takes off from rest at any point of support located on the surface of the earth and to terminate when it next comes to a complete stop at a point of support located on the surface of the earth.

(b) The term “aviation accident” shall be construed to mean an accident in which a member who is required to participate frequently and regularly in aerial flight is injured or otherwise incapacitated as the result, as attested by the appropriate medical authority of the uniformed service concerned, of (1) jumping from, being thrown from or being struck by, an aircraft, glider, or spacecraft, or any part or auxiliary thereof, or (2) participation in any duly authorized aerial flight or other aircraft, glider, or spacecraft operations.

Sec. 102. Under such regulations as the Secretary concerned may prescribe, any member of the uniformed services, including members assigned to special, administrative, or school duties, may be required by competent orders to perform hazardous duty.

Sec. 103. (a) Each member who is required by competent orders to participate frequently and regularly in aerial flights, other than glider flights, shall make the flights required as a crew member or as a non-crew member as directed by competent authority.

(b) Determinations as to what constitutes duty as a crew member and duty as a non-crew member shall be made in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned: Provided, That such determinations shall be uniform for all the services to the fullest extent practicable.

Sec. 104. Under such regulations as the Secretary concerned may prescribe, members who are required by competent orders to participate frequently and regularly in aerial flights, other than glider flights, shall be required to meet the following minimum flight requirements, except as otherwise provided in section 110 hereof, in order to be entitled to receive monthly incentive pay for the performance of hazardous duty.

(a) Minimum flight requirements for members on active duty who may qualify for incentive pay under the provisions of section 301(a) of title 37, United States Code:

(1) During one calendar month: 4 hours of aerial flight; however, hours of aerial flight performed during the immediately preceding five calendar months and not already used to qualify for incentive pay may be applied to satisfy the aerial flight requirement for that month.

(2) During any two consecutive calendar months when the requirements of clause (1) above have not been met: 8 hours of aerial flight.

(3) During any three consecutive calendar months when the requirements of clause (2) above have not been met: 12 hours of aerial flight.

(4) For fractions of a calendar month, the time of aerial flight required shall bear the same ratio to the time required for a full calendar month as the period in question bears to a full calendar month.

(5) For fractions of two consecutive calendar months, the period in question shall be considered as a unit and the time of aerial flight required shall bear the same ratio to the time required for a full calendar month as the period in question bears to a full calendar month.

(6) Whenever, under authority conferred by the Secretary concerned, the commanding officer of any member who has been required by competent orders to participate frequently and regularly in aerial flights, other than glider flights, certifies that on account of military operations of the particular command or on account of the unavailability of aircraft such member was unable to perform the aerial flights required by this section, such member may comply with the minimum flight requirements by performing at least 24 hours of aerial flight over a period of six consecutive calendar months, and such requirements may be met at any time during such period.

(b) Minimum flight requirements for members of reserve components of the uniformed services on inactive-duty training who may qualify for incentive pay under the provisions of section 301(f) of title 37, United States Code:

(1) During one calendar month: 2 hours of aerial flight; however, hours of aerial flight performed during the immediately preceding five calendar months and not already used to qualify for incentive pay may be applied to satisfy the aerial flight requirement for that month.

(2) During any two consecutive calendar months, when the requirements of clause (1) above have not been met: 4 hours of aerial flight.

(3) During any three consecutive calendar months when the requirements of clause (2) above have not been met: 6 hours of aerial flight.

(4) For fractions of a calendar month, the time of aerial flight required shall bear the same ratio to the time required for a full calendar month as the period in question bears to a full calendar month.

(5) For fractions of two consecutive calendar months, the period in question shall be considered as a unit and the time of aerial flight required shall bear the same ratio to the time required for a full calendar month as the period in question bears to a full calendar month.

(c) Minimum flight requirements for members of reserve components of the uniformed services who perform both active-duty and inactive-duty training during the same calendar month and who may qualify for incentive pay under the provisions of both sections 301(a) and 301(f) of title 37 of the United States Code:

(1) For periods of active duty, those prescribed by clause (4) of subsection (a) of this section.

(2) For periods of inactive-duty training, those prescribed by clause (4) of subsection (b) of this section.

However, the total flight requirements as determined by clauses (1) and (2) of this subsection may be met at any time during such calendar month—

(i) on inactive-duty training, or

(ii) on active-duty and inactive-duty training, if the inactive-duty flight requirement for such month has been met.

Sec. 105. Members shall not be entitled to receive incentive pay for participation in aerial flights for any period while suspended from such participation, unless such suspension is subsequently removed and the minimum flight requirements prescribed in section 104 hereof have been complied with, except as otherwise provided in section 110 and 114 hereof.

Sec. 106. (a) As determined by the Secretary of the Navy, a member who is entitled to basic pay, who holds or is in training leading to a submarine duty designator, and who is in and remains in the submarine service on a career basis, is entitled to continuous monthly submarine duty incentive pay, subject to the performance of the required number of years of operational submarine duty (37 U.S.C. 301c(a)(3)–(4)), except as provided by 37 U.S.C. 301c(c).

(b) As determined by the Secretary of the Navy, a member who is entitled to basic pay but is not entitled to continuous monthly submarine duty incentive pay is entitled to submarine duty incentive pay for any period during which such member performs frequent and regular operational submarine duty required by orders.

(c) To the extent provided for by appropriations, a member of the Naval Reserve who is entitled to compensation under Section 206 of Title 37 of the United States Code, and who performs, under orders, duty on a submarine during underway operations, is eligible for an increase in such compensation equal to one-thirtieth of the monthly submarine duty incentive pay for the performance of that duty by a member of a corresponding grade and years of service who is entitled to basic pay when those orders specify such increased entitlement.
Such member is eligible for the increase for each day served, for as long as he is qualified for it, during each regular period of appropriate duty.

(d) The Secretary of the Navy is hereby designated and empowered to issue additional implementing regulations with respect to entitlement of regular and reserve officers and enlisted members of the Navy to submarine duty incentive pay, or continuous monthly submarine duty incentive pay.

Sec. 107. (a) Members who are qualified as glider personnel under such regulations as the Secretary concerned may prescribe, or who are undergoing training for such qualification, and who are required by competent orders to participate frequently and regularly in glider flights shall be required to perform one or more glider flights, without regard to duration thereof, during any three consecutive calendar months in order to be entitled to receive incentive pay for such period.

(b) Whenever, under authority conferred by the Secretary concerned, the commanding officer of any member who has been required by competent orders to participate frequently and regularly in glider flights certifies that on account of the absence or inadequacy of glider equipment or towing aircraft or other means of propulsion, or on account of military operations of the particular command, such member was unable to perform the glider flights required by this section, such member may comply with the minimum flight requirements by performing four or more glider flights, without regard to duration thereof, during a period of 12 consecutive calendar months, and such requirements may be met at any time during such period.

(c) Members of reserve components of the uniformed services who have complied with the requirement prescribed in this section shall be entitled to receive incentive pay for both active-duty and inactive-duty training performed during such period.

Sec. 108. (a) As used in section 301(a) of title 37 of the United States Code, the term “duty involving parachute jumping as an essential part of military duty” shall be construed to mean duty performed by members who, under such regulations as the Secretary concerned may prescribe, have received a rating as a parachutist or parachute rigger, or are undergoing training for such a rating, and who are required by competent orders to engage in parachute jumping from an aircraft in aerial flight.

(b) Members required by competent orders to engage in parachute jumping shall be required to perform one or more parachute jumps from an airplane in flight during any three consecutive calendar months in order to be entitled to receive incentive pay for such period.

(c) Whenever, under authority conferred by the Secretary concerned, the commanding officer of any member who has been required by competent orders to participate in parachute jumping certifies that on account of the absence of jump equipment or aircraft or on account of military operations of the particular command such member was unable to make the jumps required by this subsection, such member may comply with the minimum requirements by performing four jumps during a period of 12 consecutive calendar months, and such requirements may be met at any time during such period.
The minimum requirements may be waived by the commanding officer of a member for any period that the member is unable to perform the required jumps by reason of being engaged in combat operations in a hostile fire area designated under Section 310 of Title 37 of the United States Code.

(f) The term “duty involving frequent and regular participation in flight operations on the flight deck of an aircraft carrier or of a ship other than an aircraft carrier from which aircraft are launched” shall be construed to mean duty performed by members who are designated for and ordered to such duty by competent authority from among the crew of a ship from which aircraft are launched or an aviation unit operating from that type of ship, and who, in any calendar month (1) participate in flight operations on the flight deck during a minimum of four days, or (2) participate, on the flight deck, in a minimum number of aircraft launches or recoveries, or both, that is prescribed by the Secretary concerned as the equivalent of participation under clause (1). No member shall be entitled, however, to receive the pay provided for in this subsection if, during any month or portion thereof, he is also eligible to receive incentive pay for other hazardous duty under the provisions of Section 301 of Title 37, United States Code.

(g) The term “duty involving the servicing of aircraft or missiles with highly toxic fuels or propellants or the testing of aircraft or missile systems (or components of such systems) during which highly toxic fuels or propellants are used” shall be construed to mean duty performed by members as a primary duty that requires (1) removal, replacement, and servicing of the emergency power unit of an aircraft with H–70 propellant (30 percent water, 70 percent hydrazine); (2) participation by those personnel performing duties described in (g)(1) who must also participate in an emergency response force, spill containment, or spill cleanup involving H–70 propellant (30 percent water, 70 percent hydrazine); (3) handling and maintaining the liquid propellants (liquid oxidizer-nitrogen tetroxide; unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine) used in the Titan weapon system, if such duty requires qualification in the use of the Rocket Fuel Handler's Clothing Outfit and involves (A) launch duct operations, including flow, pressurization, on-load, set-up or tear down involving propellant transfer operations; (B) set-up, installation or tear down for fuel/oxidizer flow; (C) decontamination of equipment, including, but not limited to, the Rocket Fuel Handler's Clothing Outfit; (D) venting or pressurizing missile fuel or oxidizer tanks; (E) removing or replacing missile components while missile fuel and oxidizer tanks are loaded with such propellants; (F) transferring propellants between commercial and military holding trailers, or between holding trailers and fuel/oxidizer pump rooms; or normal preventive maintenance activities including, but not limited to, seal changes; (4) handling and maintaining the propellants, unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine and inhibited red-fuming nitric acid, used in the LANCE missile system; (5) handling, transporting or working with toxic fuels/propellants by members assigned to the Air Force Rocket Propulsion Lab (AFRPL) who (A) directly manage and inspect the activities of crew members conducting operations involving experimental rocket propulsion systems and components; (B) directly monitor and set up measurement instruments in operational areas where contamination is suspected or may be physically present; (C) install and remove instrumentation devices from propulsion systems and components; (D) perform final test preparation and immediate safety inspection duties around pressurized, active systems during prerun and postrun test periods; or, (E) install and repair electrical systems; (6) handling, loading/unloading and transporting toxic fuels and oxidizers at the precision sled track while working with the liquid rocket sled, which uses JP–X (a mixture of jet fuel (JP–4) and unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine) and red-fuming nitric acid and a propulsion; or (7) involvement with other toxic substances contained in missile or aircraft weapon system fuels or propellants as determined by the Secretary concerned.
The entitlement to the pay provided for in this subsection is based upon the performance of such duty which has the potential for accidental or inadvertent exposure to highly toxic fuels or propellants or related substances and not upon actual quantifiable exposure to such substances.
Therefore, neither this construction of the term nor the receipt of the pay provided for in this subsection may be construed as indicating that any person entitled to such pay has been actually exposed to highly toxic fuels or propellants or related substances contrary to the provisions of any statute, Executive order, rule, or regulation relating to health or safety which is applicable to the uniformed services.

(h) The term “duty involving frequent and regular exposure to highly toxic pesticides” shall be construed to mean duty performed by members who, while under competent orders assigning such members to the entomology, pest control, pest management, or preventive medicine functions of a uniformed service for a period of 30 consecutive days or more, are required to perform in any calendar month a fumigation task utilizing (1) phosphine, sulfuryl fluoride, hydrogen cyanide, methyl bromide, or (2) a fumigant of comparable high acute toxicity and hazard potential.
The use of solid fumigant formulations, such as aluminum phosphide, magnesium phosphide and calcium cyanide, in the outdoor control of burrowing animals does not qualify a member for incentive pay under this subsection.

The term does not include the handling of the individual components of binary chemical agents or munitions.
The term does not include user handling incident to loading, firing, or otherwise launching the toxic chemical munitions nor field storage operations during hostilities.
The term also excludes the handling of Research, Development, Testing and Evaluation Dilute Solutions of toxic chemicals as defined by the Secretary concerned.
It also excludes the handling of riot control agents, chemical defoliants and herbicides, smoke, flame and incendiaries, and industrial chemicals.
The entitlement to the pay provided for in this subsection is based upon the performance of such duty that has the potential for accidental exposure to chemical agents and not upon actual quantifiable exposure to such agents.
Therefore, neither the construction of the term nor the receipt of pay provided for in this subsection may be construed as indicating that any person entitled to such pay actually has been exposed to chemical agents contrary to the provisions of any statute, executive order, rule, or regulations relating to the health and safety which is applicable to the uniformed services.

Sec. 110. Any member who is required by competent orders to perform hazardous duty, or multiple hazardous duties, and who becomes injured or otherwise incapacitated as a result of the performance of any such hazardous duty, by aviation accident or otherwise, shall be deemed to have fulfilled all of the requirements for the performance of all hazardous duties which he is required by competent orders to perform, for a period not to exceed three months following the date as of which such incapacity is determined by the appropriate medical authority.

Dual payments of incentive pay shall be limited to those members who are required by competent orders to perform specific multiple hazardous duties in order to carry out their assigned missions.

Sec. 113. The Secretaries concerned are hereby authorized to prescribe such supplementary regulations not inconsistent herewith as they may deem necessary or desirable for carrying out these regulations, and such supplementary regulations shall be uniform for all the services to the fullest extent practicable.

Sec. 114. Under such regulations as the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation may prescribe with respect to enlisted members within their respective jurisdictions, any enlisted member who has been required by competent orders to perform duty as a crew member involving frequent and regular participation in aerial flight shall, if he is involuntarily removed from the performance of that duty, under circumstances prescribed by such regulations with less than 120 days’ advance notice, be deemed to have fulfilled all of the requirements for payment of incentive pay under section 301(a)(1) or (f) of title 37 of the United States Code, for that duty for up to 120 days after the date on which he was notified of such removal.

§301a. Incentive pay: aviation career

(a)(1) Subject to regulations prescribed by the President, a member of a uniformed service who is entitled to basic pay is also entitled to aviation career incentive pay in the amount set forth in subsection (b) for the frequent and regular performance of operational or proficiency flying duty required by orders.

(2) Aviation career incentive pay shall be restricted to regular and reserve officers who hold, or are in training leading to, an aeronautical rating or designation and who engage and remain in aviation service on a career basis.

(3) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Transportation with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy, or the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Health and Human Services with respect to members under their respective jurisdiction, an officer (except a flight surgeon or other medical officer) who is entitled to basic pay, holds an aeronautical rating or designation, and is qualified for aviation service under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, is entitled to continuous monthly incentive pay in the amount set forth in subsection (b) that is applicable to him.
A flight surgeon or other medical officer who is entitled to basic pay, holds an aeronautical rating or designation, and is qualified for aviation service under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, is not entitled to continuous monthly incentive pay but is entitled to monthly incentive pay in the amounts set forth in subsection (b) for the frequent and regular performance of operational flying duty.

(4) To be entitled to continuous monthly incentive pay, an officer must perform the prescribed operational flying duties (including flight training but excluding proficiency flying) for 8 of the first 12, and 12 of the first 18 years of the aviation service of the officer.
However, if an officer performs the prescribed operational flying duties (including flight training but excluding proficiency flying) for at least 10 but less than 12 of the first 18 years of the aviation service of the officer, the officer will be entitled to continuous monthly incentive pay for the first 22 years of the officer's service as an officer.
Entitlement to continuous monthly incentive pay ceases for an officer (other than a warrant officer) upon completion of 25 years of service as an officer (as computed under section 205 of this title), but such an officer in a pay grade below pay grade O–7 remains entitled to monthly incentive pay under subsection (b)(1) for the performance of operational flying duty.

(5) If upon completion of either 12 or 18 years of aviation service it is determined that an officer has failed to perform the minimum prescribed operational flying duty requirements during the prescribed periods of time, his entitlement to continuous monthly incentive pay ceases.
For the needs of the service, the Secretary concerned may permit, on a case by case basis, an officer to continue to receive continuous monthly incentive pay despite the failure of the officer to perform the prescribed operational flying duty requirements during the prescribed periods of time so long as the officer has performed those requirements for not less than 6 years of aviation service.
The Secretary concerned may not delegate the authority in the preceding sentence to permit the payment of incentive pay under this subsection.
If at the completion of 12 years of aviation service entitlement to continuous monthly incentive pay ceases, entitlement to that pay may again commence at the completion of 18 years of aviation service upon completion of the minimum operational flying duty requirements, such pay to continue for a period of time as prescribed in accordance with this section.
However, if entitlement to continuous monthly incentive pay ceases in the case of any officer at the completion of either 12 or 18 years of aviation service, such officer remains entitled to monthly incentive pay for the performance of subsequent operational or proficiency flying duties up to the maximum period of time prescribed in accordance with this section.

(6) In this section:

(A) The term “operational flying duty” means flying performed under competent orders by rated or designated members while serving in assignments in which basic flying skills normally are maintained in the performance of assigned duties as determined by the Secretary concerned, and flying performed by members in training that leads to the award of an aeronautical rating or designation.

(B) The term “proficiency flying duty” means flying performed under competent orders by rated or designated members while serving in assignments in which such skills would normally not be maintained in the performance of assigned duties.

(C) The term “officer” includes an individual enlisted, and designated, as an aviation cadet under section 6911 of title 10.

(b) A member who satisfies the requirements described in subsection (a) is entitled to monthly incentive pay as follows:

(1) For a member who is qualified under subsection (a):

Phase I	Years of aviation service (including flight training) as an officer:	Monthly rate
	2 or less	$125
	Over 2	156
	Over 3	188
	Over 4	206
	Over 6	650

Phase II	Years of service as an officer:	Monthly rate:
	Over 18	$585
	Over 20	495
	Over 22	385
	Over 25	250

An officer is entitled to the rates in phase I of this table until he has completed 18 years of service as an officer, after which his entitlement is as prescribed by the rates in phase II, if he has completed at least 6 years of aviation service as an officer.
However, if he has over 18 years of service as an officer, but not at least 6 years of aviation service as an officer, he continues to be subject to the rates set forth in phase I of the table that apply to an officer who has less than 6 years of aviation service as an officer.
An officer in a pay grade above O–6 is entitled, until he completes 25 years of service as an officer, to be paid at the rates set forth in this table, except that an officer in pay grade O–7 may not be paid at a rate greater than $200 a month, and an officer in pay grade O–8, or above, may not be paid at a rate greater than $206 a month.

(2) For a warrant officer who is qualified under subsection (a):

 	Years of aviation service as an officer:	Monthly rate
	2 or less	$125
	Over 2	156
	Over 3	188
	Over 4	206
	Over 6	650

For the purposes of clauses (1) and (2), the term “aviation service” means the service performed, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, by an officer, and the years of aviation service are computed beginning with the effective date of the initial order to perform aviation service.

(c) In time of war, the President may suspend the payment of aviation career incentive pay.

(d) Under regulations prescribed by the President and to the extent provided for by appropriations, when a member of a reserve component of a uniformed service, or of the National Guard, who is entitled to compensation under section 206 of this title, performs, under orders, duty described in subsection (a) for members entitled to basic pay, he is entitled to an increase in compensation equal to 1/30 of the monthly incentive pay authorized by subsection (b)(1) or (2), as the case may be, for the performance of that duty by a member of corresponding years of aviation or officer service, as appropriate, who is entitled to basic pay.
Such member is entitled to the increase for as long as he is qualified for it, for each regular period of instruction, or period of appropriate duty, at which he is engaged for at least two hours, including that performed on a Sunday or holiday, or for the performance of such other equivalent training, instruction, duty or appropriate duties, as the Secretary may prescribe under section 206(a) of this title.
This subsection does not apply to a member who is entitled to basic pay under section 204 of this title.

If entitlement to continuous monthly submarine duty incentive pay ceases upon completion of 12 years of submarine service, entitlement to that pay may again commence upon completion of 18 years of submarine service if the minimum operational submarine duty requirements have been met, and such pay shall continue for the period of time prescribed in accordance with this section.
However, if entitlement to continuous monthly submarine duty incentive pay ceases in the case of any member at the completion of either 12 or 18 years of submarine service or 26 years of service (as computed under section 205 of this title, but excluding, in the case of an officer, periods as an enlisted member before initial appointment as an officer), such member shall be entitled to that pay in the amount set forth in subsection (b) for the performance of subsequent operational submarine duty, or for the performance of service as a member of a submarine operational command staff, if such member's duties require serving on a submarine during underway operations.

(I) during one calendar month: 48 hours, except that hours served underway in excess of 48 as a member of a submarine operational command staff during any of the immediately preceding five calendar months and not already used to qualify for incentive pay may be applied to satisfy the underway time requirements for the current month;

(II) during any two consecutive calendar months when the requirements of subclause (I) of this clause have not been met: 96 hours; or

(III) during any three consecutive calendar months when the requirements of subclause (II) of this clause have not been met: 144 hours;

(ii) while receiving instruction to prepare for assignment to a submarine of advanced design, or

(iii) while receiving instruction to prepare for a position of increased responsibility on a submarine.

(B) The term “submarine service” means the service performed, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Navy, by a member, and the years of submarine service are computed beginning with the effective date of the initial order to perform submarine service.

Any determination made under this section with regard to enlisted members is final and is not subject to review by any accounting officer of the United States or a court, unless there is fraud or gross negligence.

(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the basic allowance for quarters to which an enlisted member may be entitled as a member with dependents shall not, for such period as the Secretary concerned may prescribe, be contingent on the right of such member to receive pay.

(j)(1) The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations for the administration of this section, including definitions of the terms “field duty” and “sea duty”.

(2) The Secretary concerned may deny the right to make an election under subsection (b) if he determines that the exercise of such an election would adversely affect a training mission, military discipline, or military readiness.

(k) Parking facilities (including utility connections) provided members of the uniformed services for house trailers and mobile homes not owned by the Government shall not be considered to be quarters for the purposes of this section or any other provision of law.
Any fee established by the Government for the use of such a facility shall be established in an amount sufficient to cover the cost of maintenance, services, and utilities and to amortize the cost of construction of the facility over the 25-year period beginning with the completion of such construction.

(l)(1) The Secretary of Defense, or the Secretary of Transportation in the case of the Coast Guard when not operating as a service in the Navy, may allow the dependents of a member of the armed forces who dies in line of duty and whose dependents are occupying family housing provided by the Department of Defense, or by the Department of Transportation in the case of the Coast Guard, other than on a rental basis on the date of the member's death to continue to occupy such housing without charge for a period of 180 days.

(2) The Secretary concerned may pay an allowance for quarters to the dependents of a member of the uniformed services who dies in line of duty and whose dependents are not occupying a housing facility under the jurisdiction of a uniformed service on the date of the member's death or are occupying such housing on a rental basis on such date, or whose dependents vacate such housing sooner than 180 days after the date of the member's death.
The amount of the allowance for quarters shall be the same amount that would be payable to the deceased member under sections 403, 403a, and 405 of this title if the member had not died.
The payment of an allowance for quarters under this subsection shall terminate 180 days after the date of the member's death.

(m)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), in the case of a member of a uniformed service who is assigned to quarters of the United States or a housing facility under the jurisdiction of a uniformed service and who is authorized a basic allowance for quarters solely by reason of the member's payment of child support, the amount of the basic allowance for quarters to which the member is entitled shall be equal to the difference between the basic allowance for quarters applicable to the member's grade, rank, or rating at the with-dependent rate and the applicable basic allowance for quarters at the without-dependent rate.

(2) A member of a uniformed service shall not be entitled to a basic allowance for quarters solely by reason of the payment of child support if the monthly rate of that child support is less than the amount of the basic allowance for quarters computed for the member under paragraph (1).

(3) The application of this subsection to a member of a uniformed service shall not affect the entitlement of that member to a basic allowance for quarters at a partial rate under section 1009(c) of this title.

§403a. Variable housing allowance

(a)(1) Except as provided in subsection (b), a member of a uniformed service entitled to basic allowance for quarters is entitled to a variable housing allowance under this section whenever assigned to duty in an area of the United States which is a high housing cost area with respect to that member.
A member with dependents who is assigned to an unaccompanied tour of duty outside the United States is entitled to a variable housing allowance while serving that tour of duty for any period during which the member's dependents reside in an area of the United States where, if the member were assigned to duty in that area, the member would be entitled to receive a variable housing allowance.
The allowance authorized by this section may be paid in advance.

(2) In the case of a member with dependents—

(A) who is assigned to duty inside the United States the location or the circumstances of which make it necessary that his dependents reside at another location; and

(B) whose dependents reside in an area of the United States where, if the member were assigned to duty in that area, the member would be entitled to receive a variable housing allowance at a rate other than the rate to which the member is entitled (if at all) in the area of his duty assignment,

the member may be paid a variable housing allowance as if he were assigned to duty in the area in which his dependents reside if the Secretary concerned determines (under regulations prescribed under subsection (e)) that it would be inequitable to base the member's entitlement to, and amount of, variable housing allowance on the area to which the member is assigned.

(3) In the case of a member with dependents—

(A) who is assigned to an unaccompanied tour of duty in Alaska or Hawaii; and

(B) who would, if his duty station were outside the United States, be entitled to a family separation allowance under section 427(a) of this title,

the member may be paid a variable housing allowance at the rate applicable to a member without dependents serving in the same grade and at the same location.
Payment of a variable housing allowance under this paragraph shall be in addition to any allowance or per diem to which the member otherwise may be entitled under this title.

(4) In the case of a member with dependents—

(A) who is assigned to duty inside the United States;

(B) who is authorized to receive the basic allowance for quarters at the rate established for a member with dependents solely by reason of the payment of child support by the member; and

(C) who is not assigned to a housing facility under the jurisdiction of a uniformed service,

the member may be paid a variable housing allowance at the rate applicable to a member without dependents serving in the same grade and at the same location.

(5)(A) In the case of a member described in subparagraph (B) who is assigned to duty away from the member's principal place of residence (as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense), the member shall be considered to be assigned to duty at that residence for the purpose of determining the entitlement of the member to a variable housing allowance under this section.

(B) A member referred to in subparagraph (A) is a member of a uniformed service who—

(i) is a member of a reserve component called or ordered to active duty (other than for training) or is a retired member ordered to active duty under section 688(a) of title 10; and

(ii) is not authorized transportation of household goods under section 406 of this title from the member's principal place of residence to the place of that duty assignment.

(b) A member of a uniformed service may not be paid a variable housing allowance—

(1) in the case of a member who makes a change in permanent duty station, for the number of days that travel is authorized between permanent duty stations (under regulations prescribed under subsection (e));

(2) in the case of a member with dependents who is authorized the basic allowance for quarters at the rate established for a member with dependents solely by reason of the payment of child support by the member, if—

(A) the member is assigned to a housing facility under the jurisdiction of a uniformed service;

(B) the member (i) is assigned to duty outside the United States or in Alaska or Hawaii, and (ii) is authorized a station housing allowance under section 405 of this title; or

(C) the member is assigned to sea duty and elects not to occupy assigned quarters for unaccompanied personnel, unless the member is in a pay grade above E–4;

(3) in the case of a member of a reserve component, while on active duty under a call or order to active duty specifying a period of less than 140 days, unless the call or order to active duty is in support of a contingency operation; or

(4) unless the member makes an annual certification (in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary of Defense may prescribe) to the Secretary concerned identifying the housing costs of the member.

(c)(1) The monthly amount of a variable housing allowance under this section for a member of a uniformed service with respect to an area is equal to the greater of the following amounts:

(A) An amount equal to the difference between—

(i) the median monthly cost of housing in that area for members of the uniformed services serving in the same pay grade and with the same dependency status as that member; and

(ii) 80 percent of the median monthly cost of housing in the United States for members of the uniformed services serving in the same pay grade and with the same dependency status as that member.

(B) An amount equal to the difference between—

(i) the adequate housing allowance floor determined by the Secretary of Defense for all members of the uniformed services in that area entitled to a variable housing allowance under this section; and

(ii) the monthly basic allowance for quarters for members of the uniformed services serving in the same pay grade and with the same dependency status as that member.

(2) The rates of variable housing allowance shall be reduced as necessary to comply with subsection (d).

(3) The effective date of any adjustment in rates of variable housing allowance because of a redetermination of median monthly costs of housing under paragraph (1)(A) or the minimum amount of a variable housing allowance under paragraph (1)(B) shall be the same as the effective date of the next increase after such redetermination in the basic allowances for quarters.
However, so long as a member of a uniformed service retains uninterrupted eligibility to receive a variable housing allowance within an area and the member's certified housing costs are not reduced (as indicated by certifications provided by the member under subsection (b)(4)), the monthly amount of a variable housing allowance under this section for the member within that area may not be reduced as a result of systematic adjustments required by changes in housing costs within that area.

(4) For the purposes of this section, an area shall be considered to be a high housing cost area with respect to a member of a uniformed service whenever the median monthly cost of housing in that area for members of the uniformed services serving in the same pay grade and with the same dependency status as that member exceeds 80 percent of the median monthly cost of housing in the United States for members of the uniformed services serving in the same pay grade and with the same dependency status as that member.

(5) Any reduction required under paragraph (2) and any determination of median monthly costs of housing or minimum amount of a variable housing allowance under this subsection shall be made under regulations prescribed under subsection (e).

(6)(A) The monthly variable housing allowance that would otherwise be paid to a member under this section shall be reduced by an amount equal to one-half of the amount (if any) by which—

(i) the total monthly housing allowance prescribed for members of the same grade as such member who are assigned to duty in the same area as such member (or in the same area in which the dependents of the member reside, as appropriate), exceeds

(ii) the monthly housing costs of the member in the area in which the member is assigned to duty (or in the area in which the dependents of the member reside, as appropriate).

(B) In subparagraph (A), the term “total monthly housing allowance” means, in the case of any member, the sum of—

(i) the monthly basic allowance for quarters to which the member is entitled; and

(ii) the monthly variable housing allowance prescribed for the same grade as such member for the area in which the member is assigned to duty (or in the area in which the dependents of the member reside, as appropriate).

(7)(A) For purposes of paragraph (1)(B)(i), the Secretary of Defense shall establish an adequate housing allowance floor for members of the uniformed services in an area as a selected percentage, not to exceed 85 percent, of the cost of adequate housing in that area based on an index of housing costs selected by the Secretary of Defense from among the following:

(i) The fair market rentals established annually by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under section 8(c)(1) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f(c)(1)).

(ii) An index developed in the private sector that the Secretary of Defense determines is comparable to the fair market rentals referred to in clause (i) and is appropriate for use to determine the adequate housing allowance floor.

(B) The Secretary of Defense shall carry out this paragraph in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services.

(d)(1) The total amount that may be paid for a fiscal year for the variable housing allowance authorized members of the uniformed services by this section is the product of—

(A) the total amount authorized to be paid for such allowance for the preceding fiscal year (as adjusted under paragraph (3)); and

(B) a fraction—

(i) the numerator of which is the military housing cost index for October of the preceding fiscal year; and

(ii) the denominator of which is the military housing cost index for October of the fiscal year before the preceding fiscal year.

(2) The military housing cost index is the housing component of the Consumer Price Index (as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor), as adjusted under regulations prescribed under subsection (e). Such regulations may assign weights to the elements of that housing component other than those assigned by the Secretary of Labor in order more appropriately to reflect the distribution of elements of housing costs of members of the uniformed services.

(3) In making a determination under paragraph (1) for a fiscal year, the amount authorized to be paid for the preceding fiscal year for the variable housing allowance shall be adjusted to reflect changes during the year for which the determination is made in the number, grade distribution, and dependency status of members of the uniformed services entitled to variable housing allowance from the number of such members during the preceding fiscal year.
In addition, the total amount determined under paragraph (1) shall be adjusted to ensure that sufficient amounts are available to allow payment of any additional amounts of variable housing allowance necessary as a result of the requirements of paragraph (1)(B) of subsection (c) and the second sentence of paragraph (3) of that subsection.
Adjustments under this paragraph shall be made in accordance with regulations prescribed under subsection (e).

(e)(1) The Secretary of Defense may prescribe regulations for the administration of this section.

(2) Any regulations prescribed under paragraph (1) may not allow—

(A) an increase in the variable housing allowance rate for a pay grade in an area solely to prevent the variable housing allowance rate for a lower pay grade in that area from exceeding such rate; or

(B) a failure to lower the variable housing allowance rate for a pay grade in an area in accordance with a decrease in housing costs for such pay grade in that area determined on the basis of the annual certifications of housing costs of members of the uniformed services receiving a variable housing allowance for that area.

(3) Paragraph (2) shall not apply to regulations prescribed with respect to any pay grade in an area for which available data describe fewer than 50 persons in the pay grade.

(f) The monthly rate of a variable housing allowance for members of the uniformed services in the same pay grade and dependency status in an area may not be reduced pursuant to subsection (c)(2), a redetermination of median monthly costs of housing under that subsection, or any other law to the extent that the total amount of monthly basic pay, basic allowance for quarters, basic allowance for subsistence, and variable housing allowance for that grade and status is reduced, as a result of such a reduction in variable housing allowance, below the monthly total of those items of pay and allowances for the month preceding the effective date of the most recent increase in the rate of basic pay for that grade.

(b) Eligible Members.—The following members are eligible to receive a cost-of-living allowance under this section:

(1) A member assigned to a high cost area in the continental United States.

(2) A member assigned to an unaccompanied tour of duty outside the continental United States if the primary dependent of the member resides in a high cost area in the continental United States.

(3) A member assigned to duty in the continental United States if the Secretary of the uniformed service concerned determines that—

(A) the primary dependent of the member must reside in a high cost area in the continental United States by reason of the member's duty location or other circumstances; and

(B) it would be inequitable for the member's eligibility for the allowance to be determined on the basis of the duty location of the member.

(c) High Cost Area Defined.—An area is a high cost area for a fiscal year for purposes of this section if the uniformed services cost of living for that area for the base period exceeds the average cost of living in the continental United States for such base period by at least the threshold percentage.
The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the other administering Secretaries, shall establish the threshold percentage, except that the threshold percentage may not be less than 8 percent.
The administering Secretaries shall prescribe a higher threshold percentage to be applied for a fiscal year when it is necessary to do so in order to ensure that the total amount of the payments of the cost-of-living allowance made to members of the uniformed services under this section for such fiscal year does not exceed the total amount available to all uniformed services for that fiscal year for paying such allowance.

(d) Amount of Allowance.—The cost-of-living allowance that may be paid to a member for a high cost area for a fiscal year shall be the amount that is equal to the product of—

(1) the amount of the average spendable income determined applicable for the regular military compensation level of such member under subsection (g); and

(2) the percentage equal to the excess of—

(A) the percentage by which the uniformed services cost of living for the member's high cost area for the base period exceeds the average cost of living in the continental United States for such base period, over

(B) the threshold percentage applicable to such fiscal year under subsection (c).

(e) Limitation to One Allowance.—If primary dependents of a member reside separately in different high cost areas—

(1) the member may be paid only one cost-of-living allowance under this section; and

(2) the cost-of-living allowance payable to the member shall be the highest of the amounts computed under this section for such high cost areas.

(f) Service Not Covered.—(1) A cost-of-living allowance may not be paid a member under this section for the days authorized for travel of the member in connection with a permanent change of duty station.

(2) A member of a reserve component is not eligible for a cost-of-living allowance under this section unless the member is on active duty under a call or order to active duty that—

(A) specifies a period of 140 days or more; or

(B) states that the call or order to active duty is in support of a contingency operation.

(g) Average Spendable Income.—The Secretary of Defense shall determine, using a methodology and assumptions that the Secretary considers appropriate, the amounts of average spendable income of members of the uniformed services for various ranges of regular military compensation.
For purposes of this subsection, spendable income is the total amount of regular military compensation that is available for purchase of goods and services after allocation of amounts for taxes, insurance, housing, gifts and contributions, and savings.

(h) Joint Regulations.—The Secretary of Defense and the other administering Secretaries shall jointly prescribe regulations to carry out this section.

(i) Other Definitions.—In this section:

(B) Any other index developed in the private sector that the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the other administering Secretaries, determines is comparable to the Consumer Price Index and is appropriate for use for purposes of this section.

(3) The term “uniformed services cost of living” means the price index selected as described in paragraph (2) and adjusted as the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the other administering Secretaries, considers appropriate to reflect variations between expenses of members of the uniformed services (as offset by the basic allowance for subsistence) and the corresponding expenses of persons not members of the uniformed services with regard to the following:

(A) Nonhousing costs (including costs of transportation, goods, and services, taking into consideration savings attributable to use of such military facilities as commissary stores and exchange stores).

(B) Average income tax paid.

(C) Cost of health care.

(4) The term “base period”, with respect to a fiscal year, means the 12-month period ending on June 30 of the year in which such fiscal year begins.

(5) The term “administering Secretaries” means the following:

(A) The Secretary of Defense, with respect to the armed forces (other than the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy).

Section 602(b) of Pub. L. 103–337 provided that:

“(1) A cost-of-living allowance under section 403b of title 37, United States Code, as added by subsection (a), may not be provided until after the end of the 90-day period beginning on the date the Secretary of Defense submits the report required under paragraph (2).

“(2) Before implementing section 403b of title 37, United States Code, the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the other administering Secretaries (as defined in subsection (h)(6) of such section), shall submit to Congress a report describing—

(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a member who—

(i) is separated from the service or released from active duty; and

(ii) on the date of his separation from the service or release from active duty, has not served on active duty for a period of time equal to at least 90 percent of the period of time for which he initially enlisted or otherwise initially agreed to serve,

may be provided transportation under this subsection for his dependents only by transportation in kind by the least expensive mode of transportation available or by a monetary allowance that does not exceed the cost to the Government of such transportation in kind.

(ii) who is separated from the service or released from active duty for a medical condition affecting the member, as determined by the Secretary concerned;

Temporary storage in excess of 180 days may be authorized.

(B) Subject to uniform regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned, in the case of a permanent change of station in which the Secretary concerned has authorized transportation of a motor vehicle under section 2634 of title 10 (except when such transportation is authorized from the old duty station to the new duty station), the member is entitled to a monetary allowance for transportation of that motor vehicle—

(i) from the old duty station to—

(I) the customary port of embarkation which is nearest the old duty station if delivery of the motor vehicle to the port of embarkation is not made in conjunction with the member's travel to the member's port of embarkation; or

(II) the customary port of embarkation which is nearest to the member's port of embarkation if delivery of the motor vehicle to the port of embarkation is made in conjunction with the member's travel to the member's port of embarkation;

whichever is most cost-effective for the Government considering all operational, travel, and transportation requirements incident to such change of station; and

(ii) from the customary port of debarkation which has been designated by the Government as most cost-effective for the Government considering all operational, travel, and transportation requirements incident to such change of station to the new duty station.

Such monetary allowance shall be established at a rate per mile that does not exceed the rate established under section 404(d)(1) of this title.

(D) In connection with the change of temporary or permanent station of a member in a pay grade below pay grade O–6, the Secretary concerned may authorize a higher weight allowance than the weight allowance determined under subparagraph (C) for the member if the Secretary concerned determines that the application of the weight allowance determined under such subparagraph would result in significant hardship to the member or the dependents of the member.
An increase in weight allowance under this subparagraph may not result in a weight allowance exceeding the weight allowance specified in subparagraph (C) for pay grades O–6 to O–10. The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations to carry out this subparagraph.

(E) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, or the Secretary of Transportation for the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy, cadets at the United States Military Academy, the United States Air Force Academy, and the United States Coast Guard Academy, and midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy shall be entitled, in connection with temporary or permanent station change, to transportation of baggage and household effects as provided in subparagraph (A). The weight allowance for cadets and midshipmen is 350 pounds.

(2) The transportation and allowances authorized under paragraph (1) may be paid or provided to a member upon his separation from the service or release from active duty only if the member applies for the transportation and allowances not later than 180 days after the date of his separation or release from active duty.
If a member to whom this paragraph applies has been authorized nontemporary storage under subsection (d), the 180-day period shall not begin until such authorization for nontemporary storage expires.
This paragraph does not apply to a member to whom subsection (g)(1) applies.

(c) The allowances and transportation authorized by subsections (a) and (b) are in addition to those authorized by sections 404 and 405 of this title and are—

(1) subject to such conditions and limitations;

(2) for such grades, ranks, and ratings; and

(3) to and from such places;

prescribed by the Secretaries concerned.
Transportation of the household effects of a member may not be made by commercial air carrier at an estimated over-all cost that is more than the estimated over-all cost of the transportation thereof by other means, unless an appropriate transportation officer has certified in writing to his commanding officer that those household effects to be so transported are necessary for use in carrying out assigned duties, or are necessary to prevent undue hardship and other means of transportation will not fill those needs.
However, not more than 1,000 pounds of unaccompanied baggage may be transported by commercial air carrier, without regard to the preceding sentence, under regulations prescribed under the authority of the Secretary of Defense.

(d) The nontemporary storage of baggage and household effects may be authorized in facilities of the United States, or in commercial facilities when it is considered to be more economical to the United States.
However, the weight of baggage and household effects stored, plus the weight of the baggage and household effects transported, in connection with a change of station may not be more than the maximum weight limitations in regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned when it is not otherwise fixed by law.
In the event a member's baggage and household effects exceed such maximum weight limitation, the Secretary concerned, if requested to do so by the member, may pay the costs for the nontemporary storage of that excess weight and collect the amount paid from the member's pay and allowances, or collect the amount in such other manner as the Secretary concerned determines appropriate.
The nontemporary storage of baggage and household effects may not be authorized for a period longer than one year from the date the member concerned is separated from the service, retired, placed on the temporary disability retired list, discharged, or released from active duty, except as prescribed in regulations by the Secretaries concerned for a member who, on that date, or at any time during the one-year period following that date, is confined in a hospital, or is in its vicinity, undergoing medical treatment; or in the case of a member who—

(1) is retired, or is placed on the temporary disability retired list, under chapter 61 of title 10; or

(2) is retired with pay under any other law, or, immediately following at least eight years of continuous active duty with no single break therein of more than 90 days, is discharged with separation pay or severance pay or is involuntarily released from active duty with separation pay or readjustment pay.

Except in the case of a member who, on the date of his separation, discharge, or release, or at any time during the one-year period following that date, is confined in a hospital, or is in its vicinity, undergoing medical treatment, the cost of the storage, for the period that exceeds one year, shall be paid by the member.

(e) When orders directing a change of permanent station for the member concerned have not been issued, or when they have been issued but cannot be used as authority for the transportation of his dependents, baggage, and household effects, the Secretaries concerned may authorize the movement of the dependents, baggage, and household effects and prescribe transportation in kind, reimbursement therefor, or a monetary allowance in place thereof (as the case may be), plus a per diem, as authorized under subsection (a) or (b). This subsection may be used only under unusual or emergency circumstances, including those in which—

(1) the member is performing duty at a place designated by the Secretary concerned as being within a zone from which dependents should be evacuated;

(2) orders which direct the member's travel in connection with temporary duty do not provide for return to the permanent station or do not specify or imply any limit to the period of absence from his permanent station; or

(3) the member is serving on permanent duty at a station outside the United States, in Hawaii or Alaska, or on sea duty.

(f) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, transportation for dependents, baggage, and household effects of a member, plus a per diem for the member's dependents, is authorized if he dies while entitled to basic pay under chapter 3 of this title.

(g)(1) Under uniform regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned, a member who—

(A) is retired, or is placed on the temporary disability retired list, under chapter 61 of title 10;

(B) is retired with pay under any other law, or, immediately following at least eight years of continuous active duty with no single break therein of more than 90 days, is discharged with separation pay or severance pay or is involuntarily released from active duty with separation pay or readjustment pay; or

(C) is involuntarily separated from active duty during the nine-year period beginning on October 1, 1990,

is, not later than one year from the date he is so retired, placed on that list, involuntarily separated, discharged, or released, except as prescribed in regulations by the Secretaries concerned, entitled to transportation for his dependents, baggage, and household effects to the home selected under section 404(c) of this title, and to a per diem for his dependents.
In addition, baggage and household effects may be shipped to a location other than the home selected by the member.

(2) If baggage and household effects of a member are shipped to a place selected by a member as his home under section 404(c) of this title that is not a place described in clause (A) or (B) of section 404(c)(2) of this title or to a location other than the home selected by the member, or if transportation is provided for a member's dependents to a place selected by the member as his home under section 404(c) of this title that is not a place described in clause (A) or (B) of section 404(c)(2) of this title, and the costs of that shipment or transportation are in excess of those that would have been incurred if the shipment had been made or the transportation had been provided to a location in the United States (other than Alaska or Hawaii), the member shall pay that excess cost.

(3) If a member authorized to select a home under section 404(c) of this title accrues that right or any entitlement under this subsection but dies before he exercises it, that right or entitlement accrues to and may be exercised by his surviving dependents or, if there are no surviving dependents, his baggage and household effects may be shipped to the home of the person legally entitled to such baggage and effects.
However, if baggage and household effects are shipped under circumstances described in paragraph (2) in which the member would have been required to pay the excess costs of that shipment, the surviving dependents or the person legally entitled to the baggage and household effects, as the case may be, shall pay that excess cost.

(h)(1) If the Secretary concerned determines that it is in the best interests of a member described in paragraph (2) or the member's dependents and the United States, the Secretary may, when orders directing a change of permanent station for the member concerned have not been issued, or when they have been issued but cannot be used as authority for the transportation of the member's dependents, baggage, and household effects—

(A) authorize the movement of the member's dependents, baggage, and household effects at the station to an appropriate location in the United States or its possessions or, if the dependents are foreign nationals, to the country of the dependents’ origin and prescribe transportation in kind, reimbursement therefor, or a monetary allowance in place thereof, as the case may be, plus a per diem, as authorized under subsection (a) or (b); and

(B) in the case of a member described in paragraph (2)(A), authorize the transportation of one motor vehicle, which is owned or leased by the member (or a dependent of the member) and is for the personal use of a dependent of the member, to that location by means of transportation authorized under section 2634 of title 10 or authorize the storage of the motor vehicle pursuant to subsection (b) of such section.

If the member's baggage and household effects are in nontemporary storage under subsection (d), the Secretary concerned may authorize their movement to the location concerned and prescribe transportation in kind or reimbursement therefor, as authorized under subsection (b). For the purposes of this section, a member's unmarried child for whom the member received transportation in kind to his station outside the United States or in Hawaii or Alaska, reimbursement therefor, or a monetary allowance in place thereof and who, by reason of age or graduation from (or cessation of enrollment in) an institution of higher education, would otherwise cease to be a dependent of the member while the member was serving at that station shall still be considered as a dependent of the member.

(2) A member referred to in paragraph (1) is a member who—

(A) is serving at a station outside the United States or in Hawaii or Alaska;

(B) receives an administrative discharge under other than honorable conditions; or

(C) is sentenced by a court-martial—

(i) to be confined for a period of more than 30 days,

(ii) to receive a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge, or

(iii) to be dismissed from a uniformed service,

if the sentence is approved under section 860(c)(2) of title 10.

(i) A member traveling under orders who is relieved from a duty station is entitled to transportation for his dependents, baggage, and household effects, plus a per diem for the member's dependents, regardless of the time the dependents, baggage, or household effects arrive at their destination.
Appropriations of the Department of Defense available for travel or transportation that are current when the member is relieved may be used to pay for the transportation.

(j)(1) The Secretary concerned may pay a monetary allowance to a member of the armed forces or a member of the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service when the member participates in a program in which baggage and household effects of the member are transported by a privately owned or rental vehicle or in which a member provides all or a part of the labor in connection with the transportation of the baggage and household effects of the member (including packing, crating, and loading) under regulations of the Secretary concerned.
The allowance is not limited to reimbursement for actual expenses and may be paid in advance of the transportation of the baggage and household effects.
However, the amount of the allowance shall provide a savings to the United States when the total cost of the transportation is compared with the cost that would be incurred under subsection (b).

(2) The Secretary concerned may prescribe in any regulations authorizing the payment of a monetary allowance to a member who participates in a program in which the member provides all or a part of the labor in connection with the transportation of the baggage and household effects of the member—

(A) the extent to which payment to the member will be made for such labor, and

(B) the manner in which liability will be allocated among the member, the United States, and the common carriers involved in the event of loss of or damage to any baggage or household effects packed, crated, or loaded by the member.

(3) Appropriations available to the Department of Defense for providing transportation of household effects of members of the armed forces under subsection (b) shall be available to pay the monetary allowance authorized under paragraph (1) to such members.
Appropriations available to the Department of Health and Human Services for providing transportation of household effects of members of the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service under subsection (b) shall be available to pay the monetary allowance authorized under paragraph (1) to such members.

(k) Under uniform regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned, a member with dependents who is ordered to make an overseas permanent change of station and who, in anticipation of his dependents accompanying him overseas, ships baggage and household effects to that overseas station, may be authorized a return shipment of the baggage and household effects if, after the shipment, the member's dependents are unable to accompany him overseas and the Secretary concerned determines that such inability was unexpected and uncontrollable.

(l) For the purposes of this section, the residence of a dependent of a member who is a student not living with the member while at school shall be considered to be the permanent duty station of the member or the designated residence of dependents of the member if the member's dependents are not authorized to reside with the member.

(m) No carrier, port agent, warehouseman, freight forwarder, or other person involved in the transportation of property may have any lien on, or hold, impound, or otherwise interfere with, the movement of baggage and household goods being transported under this section.

Funeral Transportation and Living Expense Benefits; Vietnam Conflict

Pub. L. 93–257, Mar. 29, 1974, 88 Stat. 53, provided that:

“Section 1 [Short title]. This Act may be cited as the ‘Funeral Transportation and Living Expense Benefits Act of 1974’.

“Sec. 2 [Findings]. (a) The United States did in 1973 provide transportation and other amenities to families of five hundred and fifty-six returned prisoners of war for reunions upon these men's arrival in the continental United States after release from imprisonment by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and did in 1973 also provide transportation and other amenities to these returned prisoners of war and their families to attend ceremonies in their honor in Washington, District of Columbia.

“(b) The remains of other prisoners of war, having died in captivity in Southeast Asia, are now being returned to the United States for burial.

“(c) The United States owes no lesser degree of respect, honor or solicitude to the memories of the men who died in captivity and their families than in the cases of those who survived and returned alive to the United States.

“(d) It is fitting and proper, therefore, as a mark of respect to those men who died in captivity while serving in the Armed Forces of the United States, that comparable courtesies and amenities be extended to the families of these deceased military personnel.

“Sec. 3 [Benefits; deceased prisoners of war or members missing in action; eligible family members]. (a) The Secretary of Defense is authorized to provide funeral transportation and living expenses benefits for the family of any deceased member of the Armed Forces who shall have died while classified as a prisoner of war or as missing in action during the Vietnam conflict and whose remains shall have been returned to the United States after January 27, 1973.

“(b) Such benefits shall include transportation roundtrip from such family members’ places of residence to the place of burial for such deceased member of the Armed Forces, living expenses and other such allowances as the Secretary shall deem appropriate.

“(c) Eligible family members shall include the deceased's widow, children, stepchildren, mother, father, stepfather and stepmother, or if none of these shall desire to be granted such benefits, the deceased's brothers, sisters, halfbrothers and halfsisters.”

In subsection (a), the words “Subject to subsections (b) and (c) of this section,” are inserted for clarity.
The words “of an armed force” are inserted, since the source section, as originally enacted, did not apply to the Public Health Service or the Coast and Geodetic Survey. (See section 243 of the Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952 (66 Stat. 492).) The words “of the Army, or the Air Force, without specification of component” are inserted to reflect the definition of “reserve component” in section 102(k) of the source statute.
That definition is executed throughout this revised title.
For that reason, the words “but not as a member of the Army without specification of component or the Air Force without specification of component, in section 255(a)(2) of existing title 37”, are omitted, and since those categories are excluded by the words “member of a reserve component”. The words “of a reserve component”, in section 255(a)(3) of existing title 37, are omitted, since the Ready Reserve cannot be in anything other than a reserve component.

In subsection (b), the words “heretofore or hereafter” are omitted as surplusage.

In subsection (c), the words “An officer” are substituted for the words “any individual”, since the revised section applies only to officers.

In subsection (d), the words “who is in pay grade O–1, O–2, or O–3” are substituted for the words “is receiving the pay of the junior assistant, assistant, or senior assistant grade” to reflect current terminology. (See chapter 3 of this revised title.) The last sentence is substituted for section 214 (words following semicolon) of title 14.

In subsection (e), the words “as a temporary officer” are inserted for clarity.
The words “5596 or” are substituted for section 302(f) of the Act of August 7, 1947, cited above.

(a) Allowance Equal to Basic Allowance for Quarters.—In addition to any allowance or per diem to which he otherwise may be entitled under this title, a member of a uniformed service with dependents who is on permanent duty outside of the United States, or in Alaska, is entitled to a monthly allowance equal to the basic allowance for quarters payable to a member without dependents in the same pay grade if—

(2) quarters of the United States or a housing facility under the jurisdiction of a uniformed service are not available for assignment to him.

(b) Additional Separation Allowance.—(1) In addition to any allowance or per diem to which he otherwise may be entitled under this title, including subsection (a), a member of a uniformed service with dependents is entitled to a monthly allowance equal to $75 if—

(2) in the case of an officer, separation or release from active duty under honorable conditions; and

(3) in the case of either an officer or an enlisted member, death while on active duty unless the decedent was put to death as lawful punishment for a crime or a military offense.

(b)(1) A member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, who has accrued leave to his credit at the time of his discharge, is entitled to be paid in cash or by a check on the Treasurer of the United States for such leave on the basis of the basic pay to which he was entitled on the date of discharge.

(2) Payment may not be made under this subsection to a member who is discharged for the purpose of accepting an appointment or a warrant, or entering into an enlistment, in any uniformed service.

(3) Payment may not be made to a member for any leave he elects to have carried over to a new enlistment in any uniformed service on the day after the date of his discharge; but payment may be made to a member for any leave he elects not to carry over to a new enlistment.
However, the number of days of leave for which payment is made may not exceed sixty, less the number of days for which payment was previously made under this section after February 9, 1976.

(4) A member to whom a payment may not be made under this subsection, or a member who reverts from officer to enlisted status, carries the accrued leave standing to his credit from the one status to the other within any uniformed service.

(5) The limitation in the second sentence of paragraph (3) and in subsection (f) shall not apply with respect to leave accrued—

(c) Unused accrued leave for which payment is made under subsection (b) is not considered as service for any purpose.

(d)(1) Payments for unused accrued leave under subsections (b) and (g), in the case of a member who dies while on active duty or in the case of a member or former member who dies after retirement or discharge and before he receives that payment, shall be made in accordance with section 2771 of title 10. In the case of a member who dies while on active duty, payment for unused accrued leave under subsections (b) and (g) shall be based upon the unused accrued leave the member carried forward into the leave year during which he died plus the unused leave that accrued to him during that leave year.

(2) The limitations in the second sentence of subsection (b)(3), subsection (f), and the second sentence of subsection (g) shall not apply with respect to a payment made under this subsection.

(e)(1) A member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who is discharged under other than honorable conditions forfeits all accrued leave to his credit at the time of his discharge.

(f) The number of days upon which payment under subsection (b) or (g) is based may not exceed sixty, less the number of days for which payment has been previously made under such subsections after February 9, 1976. For the purposes of this subsection, the number of days upon which payment may be based shall be determined without regard to any break in service or change in status in the uniformed services.

(g) An officer of the Regular Corps of the Public Health Service, or an officer of the Reserve Corps of the Public Health Service on active duty, who is credited with accumulated and accrued annual leave on the date of his separation, retirement, or release from active duty, shall, if his application for that leave is approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, be paid for that leave in a lump-sum on the basis of his basic pay, subsistence allowance, and allowance for quarters whether or not he is receiving that allowance on that date.
However, the number of days upon which the lump-sum payment is based is subject to subsection (f). A lump-sum payment may not be made under this subsection to an officer—

(1) whose appointment expires or is terminated and who, without a break in active service, accepts a new appointment;

(2) who is retired for age in time of war and is continued on, or recalled to, active duty without a break in active service; or

(3) who is transferred to another department or agency of the United States under circumstances in which, by any other law, his leave may be transferred.

In this subsection, the term “accumulated annual leave” means unused accrued annual leave carried forward from one leave year into the next leave year, and the term “accrued annual leave” means the annual leave accruing to an officer during one leave year.

(h) Payment shall be made for all leave accumulated under section 701(g) of title 10 as soon as possible after the name of the person concerned is removed from a missing status, as defined in section 551(2) of this title.

Section Referred to in Other Sections

This section is referred to in section 501 of this title; title 10 sections 701, 1032, 1035, 1095a, 2181, 4342, 6954, 9342, 12301; title 26 section 112.

§552. Pay and allowances; continuance while in a missing status; limitations

(a) A member of a uniformed service who is on active duty or performing inactive-duty training, and who is in a missing status, is—

(1) for the period he is in that status, entitled to receive or have credited to his account the same pay and allowances, as defined in this chapter, to which he was entitled at the beginning of that period or may thereafter become entitled; and

(2) for the period, not to exceed one year, required for his hospitalization and rehabilitation after termination of that status, under regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned, with respect to incentive pay, considered to have satisfied the requirements of section 301 of this title so as to entitle him to a continuance of that pay.

However, a member who is performing full-time training duty or other full-time duty without pay, or inactive-duty training with or without pay, is entitled to the pay and allowances to which he would have been entitled if he had been on active duty with pay.
Notwithstanding section 1523 of title 10 or any other provision of law, the promotion of a member while he is in a missing status is fully effective for all purposes.

(b) The expiration of a member's term of service while he is in a missing status does not end his entitlement to pay and allowances under subsection (a). Notwithstanding the death of a member while in a missing status, entitlement to pay and allowances under subsection (a) ends on the date—

(1) the Secretary concerned receives evidence that the member is dead; or

(2) that his death is prescribed or determined under section 555 of this title or under chapter 76 of title 10.

(c) A member is not entitled to pay and allowances under subsection (a) for a period during which he is officially determined to be absent from his post of duty without authority, and he is indebted to the United States for payments from amounts credited to his account for that period.

(d) A member who is performing full-time training duty or inactive-duty training is entitled to the benefits of this section only when he is officially determined to be in a missing status that results from the performance of duties prescribed by competent authority.

(e) A member in a missing status who is continued in that status under section 555 of this title or under chapter 76 of title 10 is entitled to be credited with pay and allowances under subsection (a).

Under regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned, and in place of the transportation of household and personal effects, a dependent, who would otherwise be entitled to transportation of household and personal effects under this section, may transport a house trailer or mobile dwelling within and between the areas specified in section 409 of this title for use as a residence by one of the following means—

(1) transport it and be reimbursed by the United States;

(2) deliver it to an agent of the United States for transportation by the United States or by commercial means; or

(3) have it transported by commercial means, and be reimbursed by the United States.

If a trailer or dwelling is transported under clause (2) or (3), that transportation may include one privately owned motor vehicle which may be shipped at United States expense.
Transportation, and incidental costs, authorized by this section shall be at United States expense without any cost limitation, and any payment authorized may be made in advance of the transportation concerned.

(b) Transportation (including packing, crating, drayage, temporary storage, and unpacking of household and personal effects) may be provided for the dependents and household and personal effects of a member of a uniformed service on active duty (without regard to pay grade) who is officially reported as dead, injured, ill, or absent for a period of more than 29 days in a missing status—

(1) to the member's official residence of record;

(2) to the residence of his dependent, next of kin, or other person entitled to custody of the effects, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned; or

(3) on request of the member (if injured or ill), or his dependent, next of kin, or other person described in clause (2), to another location determined in advance or later approved by the Secretary concerned, or his designee.

When he considers it necessary, the Secretary concerned may, with respect to the household and personal effects of a member who is officially reported as absent for a period of more than 29 days in a missing status, authorize the nontemporary storage of those effects for a period of one year, or longer when justified.
In addition, he may authorize additional movements of, and prescribe transportation for, the dependents and household and personal effects, or the dependents and house trailer or mobile dwelling, of a member who is officially reported as absent for a period of more than one year in a missing status.

(c) When a member described in subsection (b) is in an injured or ill status, transportation of dependents and household and personal effects authorized by this section may be provided only when prolonged hospitalization or treatment is anticipated.

(d) Transportation requested by a dependent may be authorized under this section only if there is a reasonable relationship between the circumstances of the dependent and the requested destination.

(e) In place of the transportation for dependents authorized by this section, and after the travel is completed, the Secretary concerned may authorize—

(1) reimbursement for the commercial cost of the transportation; or

(2) a monetary allowance at the prescribed rate for all, or that part, of the travel for which transportation in kind is not furnished.

(f) The Secretary concerned may store the household and personal effects of a member described in subsection (b) until proper disposition can be made.
The cost of the storage and transportation (including packing, crating, drayage, temporary storage, and unpacking) of household and personal effects shall be charged against appropriations currently available.

(g) The Secretary concerned may, when he determines that there is an emergency and a sale would be in the best interests of the United States, provide for the public or private sale of motor vehicles and other bulky items of household and personal effects of a member described in subsection (b). Before a sale, and if practicable, a reasonable effort shall be made to determine the desires of the interested persons.
The net proceeds received from the sale shall, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, be sent to the owner or other persons.
If there are no such persons, or if they or their addresses are not known within one year from the date of sale, the net proceeds may be covered into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.

(h) Claims for net proceeds that are covered into the Treasury under subsection (g) may be filed with the Secretary of Defense by the rightful owners, their heirs or next of kin, or their legal representatives at any time before the end of a 5-year period from the date the proceeds are covered into the Treasury.
When a claim is filed, the Secretary of Defense shall allow or disallow it.
A claim that is allowed shall be paid from the appropriation for refunding money erroneously received and covered.
If a claim is not filed before the end of the 5-year period from the date the proceeds are covered into the Treasury, it is barred from being acted on by the courts or the Secretary of Defense.

(1) death or finding of death;

(2) the fact of dependency under this chapter;

(3) the fact of dependency for the purpose of paying six months’ death gratuities authorized by law;

(4) the fact of dependency under any other law authorizing the payment of pay, allowances, or other emoluments to enlisted members of the armed forces, when the payments are contingent on dependency;

(5) any other status covered by this chapter;

(6) an essential date, including one on which evidence or information is received by the Secretary concerned; and

(7) whether information received concerning a member of a uniformed service is to be construed and acted on as an official report of death.

Paragraphs (1), (5), (6), and (7) only apply with respect to a case to which section 555 of this title applies.

(b) When the Secretary concerned, in a case to which section 555 of this title applies, receives information that he considers establishes conclusively the death of a member of a uniformed service, he shall, notwithstanding any earlier action relating to death or other status of the member, act on it as an official report of death.
After the end of the 12-month period in a missing status prescribed by section 555 of this title, the Secretary concerned, or his designee, shall, when he considers that the information received, or a lapse of time without information, establishes a reasonable presumption that a member in a missing status is dead, make a finding of death.

(c) The Secretary concerned, or his designee, may determine the entitlement of a member to pay and allowances under this chapter, including credits and charges in his account, and that determination is conclusive.
An account may not be charged or debited with an amount that a member captured, beleaguered, or besieged by a hostile force may receive or be entitled to receive from, or have placed to his credit by, the hostile force as pay, allowances, or other compensation.

(d) The Secretary concerned, or his designee, may, when warranted by the circumstances, reconsider a determination made under this chapter, and change or modify it.

(e) When the account of a member has been charged or debited with an allotment paid under this chapter, the amount so charged or debited shall be recredited to the account of the member if the Secretary concerned, or his designee, determines that the payment was induced by fraud or misrepresentation to which the member was not a party.

(f) Except an allotment for an unearned insurance premium, an allotment paid from pay and allowances of a member for the period he is entitled to pay and allowances under section 552 of this title may not be collected from the allottee as an overpayment when it was caused by delay in receiving evidence of death.
An allotment payment for a period after the end of entitlement to pay and allowances under this chapter, or otherwise, which was caused by delay in receiving evidence of death, may not be collected from the allottee or charged against the pay of the deceased member.

(g) The Secretary concerned, or his designee, may waive the recovery of an erroneous payment or overpayment of an allotment to a dependent if he considers recovery is against equity and good conscience.

(h) For the sole purpose of determining pay under this section, a dependent of a member of a uniformed service on active duty is treated as if he were a member.
Any determination made by the Secretary concerned, or his designee, under this section in a case to which section 555 of this title applies is conclusive on all other departments and agencies of the United States.

§558. Income tax deferment

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a Federal income tax return of, or the payment of a Federal income tax by, a member of a uniformed service who, at the time the return or payment would otherwise become due, is in a missing status, does not become due until the earlier of the following dates—

(1) the fifteenth day of the third month in which he ceased (except by reason of death or incompetency) being in a missing status, unless before the end of that fifteenth day he is again in a missing status; or

(2) the fifteenth day of the third month after the month in which an executor, administrator, or conservator of the estate of the taxpayer is appointed.

That due date is prescribed subject to the power of the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate to extend the time for filing the return or paying the tax, as in other cases, and to assess and collect the tax as provided by sections 6851, 6861, and 6871 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 in cases in which the assessment or collection is jeopardized and in cases of bankruptcy or receivership.

(2) The term “former captive” means a person who, as a member of the uniformed services, was held in a captive status.

(b)(1) The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish a savings fund to which the Secretary concerned may allot all or any portion of the pay and allowances of any member of the uniformed services who is in a captive status to the extent that such pay and allowances are not subject to an allotment under section 553 of this title or any other provision of law.

(2) Amounts so allotted shall bear interest at a rate which, for any calendar quarter, shall be equal to the average rate paid on United States Treasury bills with three-month maturities issued during the preceding calendar quarter.
Such interest shall be computed quarterly.

(3) Amounts in the savings fund credited to a member shall be considered as pay and allowances for purposes of section 553(c) of this title and shall otherwise be subject to withdrawal under procedures which the Secretary of the Treasury shall establish.

(4) Any interest accruing under this subsection on—

(A) any amount for which a member is indebted to the United States under section 552(c) of this title shall be deemed to be part of the amount due under such section; and

(i) may defer such payment in the case of any former captive who during such one-year period is charged with an offense described in clause (ii), until final disposition of such charge; and

(ii) may deny such payment in the case of any former captive who is convicted of a captivity-related offense—

(I) referred to in subsection (b) or (c) of section 8312 of title 5; or

(II) under chapter 47 of title 10 (the Uniform Code of Military Justice) that is punishable by dishonorable discharge, dismissal, or confinement for one year or more.

(B) For the purposes of subparagraph (A), a captivity-related offense is an offense that is—

(i) committed by a person while the person is in a captive status; and

(ii) related to the captive status of the person.

(4) A payment under this subsection is in addition to any other amount provided by law.

(5) Any amount due a person under this subsection shall, after the death of such person, be deemed to be pay and allowances for the purposes of this chapter.

(6) Any payment made under paragraph (1) that is later denied under paragraph (3)(A)(ii) is a claim of the United States Government for purposes of section 3711 of title 31.

(d) A determination by the President under subsection (a)(1) or (c) is final and is not subject to judicial review.

§601. Applicability

This chapter applies to—

(1) members of a uniformed service who are on active duty (other than for training) or who are on a retired list of that service; and

(2) members of the Fleet Reserve or Fleet Marine Corps Reserve.

(Pub. L. 87–649, Sept. 7, 1962, 76 Stat. 483.)

	601	37:351.	June 21, 1950, ch. 342, §1, 64 Stat. 249.

The words “on active duty (other than for training)” are substituted for the words “on the active . . . list” to conform to longstanding administrative construction, and because there is no “active list” in the case of many of the uniformed services named, but only for certain regular component of those services, e.g., the “Regular Army” and the “Regular Air Force”. The words “a retired list of that service” are substituted for the words “retired list”, since there is more than one retired list for many of the services named. (See sections 1376, 3966, and 8966 of title 10, for example.) The words “members of the Reserve components of the respective services entitled to Federal pay either on the active or any retired list of said services” are omitted as covered by clause (1), since members of the reserve components are members of the uniformed services concerned.
The word “transferred” is omitted as surplusage.

§602. Payments: designation of person to receive amounts due

(a) Active duty pay and allowances, amounts due for accrued or accumulated leave, or retired or retainer pay, that are otherwise payable to a member to whom this chapter applies and who, in the opinion of a board of medical officers or physicians, is mentally incapable of managing his affairs, may be paid for that member's use or benefit to any person designated by the Secretary concerned, or by any officer to whom he delegates his authority under this section, without the appointment in judicial proceedings of a committee, guardian, or other legal representative.

(b) The board shall consist of at least three qualified medical officers or physicians, one of whom is specially qualified in the treatment of mental disorders, appointed from available medical officers or physicians under his jurisdiction by the head of whichever of the following is providing medical treatment for the member, or by a person designated by that head—

(1) Department of the Army;

(2) Department of the Navy;

(3) Department of the Air Force;

(4) Department of Health and Human Services; or

(5) Department of Veterans Affairs.

If the hospitalization or medical care of the member is not provided by the United States, the board shall be appointed by the Secretary of the department having jurisdiction of the member.

(c) A payment made to a person who is designated under this section discharges the obligation of the United States as to the amount paid.

(d) A person serving in a legal, medical, fiduciary, or other capacity, may not demand or accept a fee, commission, or other charge for any service performed under this chapter.

(e) This section does not apply in any case in which a legal committee, guardian, or other representative has been appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction, except as to payments made before the paying agency of the department concerned receives notice of that appointment.

(f) A person who is designated to receive payments under this section shall furnish satisfactory assurance that the amounts received by him will be applied to the use and benefit of the incompetent member, and, where the payments may reasonably be expected to be more than $1,000, shall provide a suitable bond to be paid for out of amounts due the incompetent member.

Such allotments may include a maximum of six allotments considered to be discretionary under such regulations.
For a member or former member entitled to retired or retainer pay, a maximum of six discretionary allotments authorized during active military service may be continued into retired status, and new discretionary allotments may be authorized so long as the total number of discretionary allotments does not exceed six.

If an allotment is erroneously paid because the officer required by regulation to so report failed to report the death of the allotter or any other fact that makes the allotment not payable, the amount of the payment not recovered from the allottee shall, if practicable, be collected by the Secretary concerned from the officer who failed to make the report.

Applicability of the source law to the Air Force is based on Transfer Order No. 25(zzz), of the Secretary of Defense, dated October 14, 1948. Its applicability, other than to the Army and the Air Force, is based upon an opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, JAG 135: DDC; dmt.; 4229, dated July 29, 1960. The words “(but not above that of pay grade O–7)” are substituted for section 235a (proviso) of existing title 37.

§902. Pay of crews of wrecked or lost naval vessels

(a) When the accounts of the disbursing officer of a naval vessel are lost as a result of the destruction of the vessel, his return for the last month may, unless there is official evidence to the contrary, be used in computing later credits to and settling accounts of persons, other than officers, carried on his accounts.
If the return for the last month has not been made, the pay accounts may be settled on principles of equity and justice.

(b) When a naval vessel is lost or has not been heard from for so long that her loss may be presumed, the Secretary of the Navy may fix the date of loss of the vessel for the purpose of settling the accounts of persons aboard other than officers.

(c) When the crew of a naval vessel is separated from that vessel because of her wreck, loss, or destruction, the pay and emoluments of those officers and enlisted members that the Secretary considers (because of the sentence of a court-martial or the finding of a court of inquiry, or by other satisfactory evidence) to have done their utmost to save the vessel and, after the wreck, loss, or destruction, to have behaved themselves according to the discipline of the Navy, continue and shall be paid to them until their discharge or death, whichever is earlier.

§1006. Advance payments

(a) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, a member of a uniformed service may be paid in advance—

(1) not more than three months’ pay of such member upon such member's change of permanent station; or

(2) the amount of an allotment made from such member's pay to a dependent if such member is assigned or scheduled for assignment to sea duty or other duty with a unit or command deployed or to be deployed outside the United States and the allotment is made by such member not more than sixty days before the scheduled date of the assignment of such member to such duty.

(b) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, a member of a uniformed service who is on duty at a distant station where the pay and emoluments to which he is entitled cannot be disbursed regularly, may be paid in advance.

(c) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, an advance of pay to a member of a uniformed service who is on duty outside the United States, or other place designated by the Secretary of Defense, of not more than two months’ basic pay may be made to a member if the member or the dependents of the member are ordered evacuated by competent authority.
An advance of pay under this subsection is not subject to the conditions under which advances of pay may be made under subsection (a) or (b). An advance may be made on the basis of the evacuation of a member's dependents only if all dependents of members of the uniformed services are ordered evacuated from the place where the member's dependents are located.
In the case of a member with dependents, the payment may be made directly to dependents previously designated by the member.
The Secretary concerned or his designee may waive any right of recovery of not more than one month's basic pay advanced under this subsection if he finds that recovery of the advance would be against equity and good conscience or against the public interest.

(d) If a person to whom an advance of pay is made under subsection (a), (b), or (c) dies or is separated from his uniformed service, before liquidation of that advance, the amount re maining unliquidated at the time of his death or separation shall be credited to the account of the disbursing officer concerned.
However, the unliquidated amount remains a debt of that person or his estate to the United States.

(e) As far as practicable, regulations for the administration of subsections (a)–(d) shall be uniform for all of the uniformed services.

(f) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Transportation, an advance of pay of not more than three months’ pay may be made to an officer of the Coast Guard who is ordered to sea duty or to or from shore duty beyond the seas.
In addition, the Commandant of the Coast Guard may direct such advances as he considers necessary and proper to members of the Coast Guard stationed at distant stations where the pay and emoluments to which they are entitled cannot be paid regularly.

(g) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, the dislocation allowance authorized by section 407 of this title for a member of a uniformed service whose dependents are covered by section 405a(a) of this title may be paid in advance of the evacuation of the dependents and to the dependents designated by the member.

(h) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of section 3324 of title 31, the Secretary concerned may, when the last day of the pay period falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, authorize the payment of pay and allowances to members of uniformed service under his jurisdiction on the preceding workday but not more than three days before the last day of that pay period.
If a member dies after he has received an advance payment under this subsection, but before the last day of the pay period for which the payment is made, no part of the amount so advance is recoverable by the United States.

(i) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, not more than one month's pay may be paid in advance to a member of the Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship program upon reporting for a period of active duty required by section 2121(c) of title 10.

(j) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, not more than one month's pay may be paid in advance to a member of the Senior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps who is ordered to field training or a practice required under section 2109 of title 10.

§1009. Adjustments of compensation

(a) Whenever the General Schedule of compensation for Federal classified employees as contained in section 5332 of title 5 is adjusted upward, the President shall immediately make an upward adjustment in the—

(1) monthly basic pay authorized members of the uniformed services by section 203(a) of this title;

(2) basic allowance for subsistence authorized enlisted members and officers by section 402 of this title; and

(3) basic allowance for quarters authorized members of the uniformed services by section 403(a) of this title.

(b) An adjustment under this section shall have the force and effect of law and shall—

(1) carry the same effective date as that applying to the compensation adjustments provided General Schedule employees;

(2) be based on the rates of the various elements of compensation as defined in, or made under, section 402 or 403 of this title or this section; and

(3) subject to subsections (c) and (d), provide all eligible members with an increase in each element of compensation, set forth in subsection (a), which is of the same percentage as the overall average percentage increase in the General Schedule rates of basic pay for civilian employees.

(c)(1) Whenever the President determines such action to be in the best interest of the Government, he is authorized to allocate the overall average percentage of any increase described in subsection (b)(3) among the elements of compensation specified in subsection (a) on a percentage basis other than an equal percentage basis; however, the amount allocated to the element of monthly basic pay may not be less than 75 percent of the amount that would have been allocated to the element of basic pay under subsection (b)(3).

(2) Under regulations prescribed by the President, whenever the President exercises his authority under paragraph (1) to allocate the elements of compensation specified in subsection (a) on a percentage basis other than an equal percentage basis, he may pay to each member without dependents who, under section 403(b) or (c) of this title, is not entitled to receive a basic allowance for quarters, an amount equal to the difference between (1) the amount of such increase under paragraph (1) in the amount of the basic allowance for quarters which, but for section 403(b) or (c) of this title, such member would be entitled to receive, and (2) the amount by which such basic allowance for quarters would have been increased under subsection (b)(3) if the President had not exercised such authority.

(d)(1) Subject to paragraph (2), whenever the President determines such action to be in the best interest of the Government, he may allocate the overall percentage increase in the element of basic pay that would otherwise be effective after any allocation made under subsection (c) among such pay grade and years-of-service categories as he considers appropriate.

(2) In making any allocation of an overall percentage increase in basic pay under paragraph (1)—

(A) the amount of the increase in basic pay for any given pay grade and years-of-service category after any allocation made under this subsection or under subsection (c) (or under both such subsections) may not be less than 75 percent of the amount of the increase in the element of basic pay that would otherwise have been effective with respect to such pay grade and years-of-service category under subsection (b)(3); and

(B) the overall percentage increase in the elements of compensation specified in subsection (a) in the case of any member of the uniformed services with four years or less service may not exceed the overall percentage increase in the General Schedule rates of basic pay for civilian employees.

(e) Whenever the President plans to exercise his authority under subsection (c) or (d) with respect to any anticipated increase in the compensation of members of the uniformed services, he shall advise the Congress, at the earliest practicable time prior to the effective date of such increase, regarding the proposed allocation of such increase.

(f) The allocations of increases made under this section shall be assessed in conjunction with the quadrennial review of military compensation required by section 1008(b) of this title.
