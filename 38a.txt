Rule 1. Scope of Rules

(a) Scope.
These rules govern practice and procedure before this Court to review decisions of the Board of Veterans’ Appeals (Board), and in applications for other relief which this Court or one of its judges is competent to give.

(b) Rules not to Affect Jurisdiction.
These rules do not extend or limit the jurisdiction of this Court as established by law.

Change of Name

Reference to United States Court of Veterans Appeals deemed to refer to United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, see section 512(c) of Pub. L. 105–368, set out as a note under section 7251 of this title.

Rule 2. Suspension of Rules

To expedite a decision, or for other good cause shown, this Court may suspend the application of any of these rules in a particular case and may order proceedings in accordance with its direction, but the Court may not extend the time for filing a Notice of Appeal.

Rule 3. How to Appeal

(a) Filing.
An appeal will be taken by filing a written Notice of Appeal with the Clerk within the time allowed by Rule 4(a). A Notice of Appeal may be filed by facsimile sent to the Clerk of the Court.
Failure of an appellant to take any step under these rules after the timely filing of a Notice of Appeal may be grounds for such action as the Court deems appropriate, which may include dismissal of the appeal.

(b) Service.
The appellant shall serve on the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (Secretary), and any other party to the proceedings before the Board, a copy of the Notice of Appeal.
See Rule 25.

(c) Content.
The Notice of Appeal shall:

(1) name the party or parties taking the appeal;

(2) designate the Board decision appealed from; and

(3) include the addresses of the appellant(s) and of any representative.

Form 1 in the Appendix of Forms is a suggested form of Notice of Appeal.
An appeal will not be dismissed for informality of the Notice of Appeal.

(d) Joint or Consolidated Appeals.
If more than one person is entitled to appeal from a decision of the Board and their interests make joinder practicable, they may file a joint Notice of Appeal or may join in an appeal after filing separate timely Notices of Appeal, and they may thereafter proceed on appeal as a single appellant.
Appeals may be consolidated by order of the Court on its own initiative or on motion of a party.

(e) Payment of Fees.
Upon the filing of any separate or joint Notice of Appeal from a decision of the Board, each appellant shall include with the Notice of Appeal a $50.00 nonrefundable filing fee payable to “U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.” If an appellant believes the payment of the fee will impose a financial hardship, the appellant may obtain a waiver of the fee by including with the Notice of Appeal a declaration of financial hardship on the form prescribed at Form 4 in the Appendix of Forms.
See Rule 24. If the Court accepts the declaration, the fee will be waived.
If the declaration is rejected for filing by the Court, the fee or an acceptable declaration must be received by the Court within the time set by the Court's rules or the appeal will be dismissed.
If a facsimile Notice of Appeal is filed, the filing fee or declaration must be received by the Court within 14 days after the facsimile was sent.

(f) Limited Appearance.
See Rule 46(d)(6).

Rule 4. When to Appeal

(a) Time for Appeal.
To obtain review by the Court of a Board decision, a person adversely affected by that decision must file a Notice of Appeal within 120 days after the date on which the Board mailed notice of the decision to the last known address of the appellant and the appellant's authorized representative, if any.
A Notice of Appeal shall be deemed to be received:

(1) on the date of its legible postmark, affixed by the United States Postal Service (not including a postage-metered date imprint other than one affixed by the United States Postal Service) on the cover in which the Notice is posted, if the mailing is properly addressed to the Court and is mailed; or

(2) on the date of its receipt by the Clerk, if it does not bear a legible postmark affixed by the United States Postal Service, or it is delivered or sent by means other than United States mail, including facsimile.

But see Rule 25(b)(3) as to an incarcerated appellant.

(b) Notice of Docketing.
The Clerk shall send a Notice of Docketing to all parties advising them of the date when the Clerk received the Notice of Appeal.

(c) Copy of Board Decision.
Within 30 days after the date of the Clerk's Notice of Docketing, the Secretary shall file and serve a copy of the Board's decision, showing the date the decision was mailed, and shall report the filing date of any motion for its reconsideration and the date and nature of any action on such a motion.

(As amended Feb. 11, 1998, eff.
Apr. 1, 1998.)

Rule 5. Suspension of Appellate Proceedings

The Court may suspend proceedings after an appeal has been filed under Rule 4: (1) on motion by the appellant seeking reconsideration by the Board; or (2) by motion of the Secretary for reasons of confession of error, by specifying the error below and the proceedings or remedy deemed to be appropriate on remand.
The Court, on its own initiative, may also suspend appellate proceedings.
See also Rule 28(b)(2).

Rules 6 and 7. (Reserved)

Rule 8. Stay or Injunction Pending Appeal

A party requesting immediate action by the Court to stay or enjoin an action by the Secretary or the Board pending an appeal to the Court shall do so by filing a motion and serving a copy of the motion on all other parties by an expedited method (including express mail, overnight delivery, facsimile or other printed electronic transmission, or hand delivery). The motion will not be accepted by the Clerk unless a Notice of Appeal has been filed.
The motion must state the reason for the relief requested and the facts relied on.
If the facts are subject to dispute, the motion must be supported by affidavits or other sworn statements or copies thereof.
The motion normally will be considered by a panel of three or more judges of the Court, but in exceptional cases the motion may be acted on by a single judge pending consideration by a panel.

Rule 9. (Reserved)

Rule 10. Designation of the Record on Appeal

(a) Designation.
Within 60 days after the date of the Clerk's Notice of Docketing, the Secretary shall file with the Clerk and serve on the appellant a designation of all material in the record of proceedings before the Secretary and the Board that was relied upon by the Board in ruling against the appellant on the issues listed by the Board and any other material from the record which the Secretary considers relevant.
The Secretary shall serve on the appellant a copy of those materials and a list of any record matter which cannot be duplicated.

(b) Counter Designation.
Within 30 days after the Secretary serves the designation of the record on appeal, the appellant shall file with the Clerk and serve on the Secretary:

(1) a counter designation of any additional material which was before the Secretary and the Board and which the appellant considers relevant to the appeal, or

(2) a statement that the appellant accepts the content of the record as designated by the Secretary.
See also Rule 11(c).

Failure of the appellant to do either will be conclusive of the appellant's acceptance of the record as designated by the Secretary.

(c) Disputes.
If any difference arises as to the content of the record on appeal, the Court, on its own initiative or on motion of a party, shall resolve the matter.
The motion of a party shall describe the good faith efforts that have been made to resolve the dispute.

(d) Irrelevant Materials.
The parties should take note that the record on appeal may not include materials not relevant to the issues on appeal.

Rule 11. Transmission of the Record on Appeal

If a party believes any additional part of the claims file before the Secretary and the Board is relevant to an issue on appeal, the party may, within 30 days after the record on appeal has been filed with the Clerk, file a motion to supplement the record, identifying the additional material to be transmitted.

(2) Opposition.
A party who believes additional material sought by another party is beyond the scope of matters relevant to the appeal may, within 14 days after service of the motion to supplement, file an opposition to the motion, describing the good faith efforts made to resolve the dispute.

(3) Supplemented record.
Within 14 days after the motion is decided, the Secretary shall transmit to the Clerk two certified copies of such supplemental record, assembled in chronological order, paginated, and accompanied by a table of contents, and shall serve a copy on the appellant.

(4) Other time limits.
Unless the Court orders otherwise, supplementation of the record does not extend the time for filing either party's brief.

(c) Access of Parties or Representatives to Original Record.

(1) Material not Subject to a Protective Order.
After a Notice of Appeal has been filed, the Secretary shall permit a party or a representative of a party to inspect and to copy material in the record before the Board.
Such inspection and copying shall be subject to reasonable regulation by the Secretary.

A person who did not intervene before the Board and who desires to intervene before the Court in a proceeding initiated by a Notice of Appeal or a petition for extraordinary relief shall serve on all parties and file with the Clerk, within 30 days after the filing of a petition for extraordinary relief or within 60 days after the date of the Clerk's Notice of Docketing in accordance with Rule 4(b), a motion for permission to intervene.
The motion must contain a concise statement of the interest of the moving person or party and the grounds upon which intervention is sought and should advise the Court of opposition to the motion, if any.

Unless the Court concludes that the petition should be denied, it will order the respondent(s) to file an answer to the petition within a time fixed by the order.
The order shall be served by the Clerk on the named respondent(s), on the Secretary, and on any other party at interest.
Two or more respondents may answer jointly.
Any respondent who does not desire to appear in the proceeding may so advise the Clerk and all parties by letter, but such action will not amount to agreement that the petition should be granted.

The proceeding will be given preference by the Court.
The petition may be acted upon after reasonable notice of its filing to all parties.

Oral argument normally is not granted on motions.

(g) Oral Argument.
Oral argument will be held as announced by the Chief Judge.

If a party dies after a Notice of Appeal is filed or while a proceeding is pending in this Court, any person claiming entitlement to accrued benefits under 38 U.S.C. §5121(a), the personal representative of the deceased party's estate, or any other appropriate person may, to the extent permitted by law, be substituted as a party on motion by such person or by any party.

(1) General.
A person of good moral character and repute who has been admitted to practice in the Supreme Court of the United States, or the highest court of any state, the District of Columbia, or a territory, possession, or commonwealth of the United States, and is in good standing therein, may be admitted to the bar of this Court upon application.

(2) Application.
An attorney at law may be admitted to the bar of the Court upon filing with the Clerk a completed application accompanied by the prescribed fee (payable by check or money order) and a current certificate from the clerk of the appropriate court showing that the applicant is a member in good standing of the bar of one of the courts named in subparagraph (1). A current court certificate is one executed within three months preceding the date of the filing of the application.

(b) Admission of Non-attorney Practitioners to Practice.
A non-attorney of good moral character and repute

(1) under the direct supervision of an attorney admitted to the bar of the Court, or

(2) employed by an organization which is chartered by Congress, is recognized by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for claims representation, and provides a statement signed by the organization's chief executive officer certifying to the employee's:

(A) understanding of the procedures and jurisdiction of the Court and of the nature, scope, and standards of its judicial review; and

(B) proficiency to represent appellants before the Court

may be admitted to practice before the Court upon filing with the Clerk a completed application accompanied by the prescribed fee (payable by check or money order). In making the certification in subparagraph (2), the chief executive officer should be aware that knowledge of and competence in veterans law and the administrative claims process does not in and of itself connote competence in appellate practice and procedure.

(c) Appearance in a Particular Case.
On motion and a showing of good cause, the Court may permit any attorney or non-attorney to appear on behalf of a party or amicus for the purpose of a particular case.
Whenever a person is admitted to practice under this subsection, the person shall be deemed to have conferred disciplinary jurisdiction upon the Court for any alleged misconduct in the course of, in the preparation for, or in connection with any proceedings in that case.

(d) Representation Requirements.

(1) Practitioner defined.
A person who has been admitted to practice under subsections (a) or (b) or has been permitted to appear under subsections (c) of this Rule 46 is referred to in this subsection (d) as a practitioner.

(2) Appearance.
No practitioner may appear on behalf of a party or amicus in any proceedings in a case without first filing:

(A) a written notice of appearance in the detail prescribed by Form 3 in the Appendix of Forms; and

(B) a copy of the fee agreement if the practitioner is representing an appellant or petitioner or intervenor, unless the representation is without charge to that party.
If the agreement provides for direct payment out of past-due benefits under 38 U.S.C. §5904, a copy must be served on the Secretary.

An appearance may not be made in the name of a law firm or other organization.

(3) Papers filed by a non-attorney.
Each paper filed by a non-attorney practitioner must include the name, address, and signature of the responsible supervising attorney under Rule 46(b)(1) or the identification of the employing organization under Rule 46(b)(2).

(4) Withdrawal.
A practitioner may withdraw from a case by filing a notice stating that the party has consented to the withdrawal, if another practitioner has previously entered an appearance on behalf of the party.
Otherwise, a practitioner may not withdraw from a case without obtaining the Court's permission by filing a motion to withdraw that

(A) lists the client's current address and telephone number, and

(B) assures the Court that

(i) the client has been notified of the motion to withdraw, and

(ii) copies of all papers filed by the parties, all notices and orders accumulated by the practitioner, and all files belonging to the client have been sent to the client or to a named substitute practitioner.

The practitioner's authority and duty continue until he or she is relieved by the Court, subject to conditions that the Court considers appropriate.

(5) Change of address.
Each practitioner and self-represented party must notify the Clerk and all other parties of any change of his or her address or telephone number.
Absent such notice, the mailing of documents to the address most recently provided by that person will be fully effective.

(6) Limited representation.
This Rule 46(d) does not apply when a practitioner files a Notice of Appeal on behalf of an appellant and specifies that the representation is limited to that filing.

(7) Subsections (2)(B), (4), (5), and (6) of this Rule 46(d) do not apply to practitioners representing the Secretary.

(e) (Rescinded)

(f) Appearance by Law Students.

(1) An eligible law student, with the written consent of the appellant and the attorney of record, who must be a member of the bar of the Court, may appear in this Court.

(2) An eligible law student may participate in the preparation of briefs and other documents to be filed in this Court, but such briefs or documents must be signed by the attorney of record.
The student may also participate in oral argument with leave of the Court, but only in the presence of the attorney of record.
The attorney of record shall assume personal professional responsibility for the law student's work and for supervising the quality of his or her work.
The attorney should be familiar with the case and prepared to supplement or correct any written or oral statement made by the student.

(3) In order to make an appearance pursuant to this rule, the student must:

(A) be duly enrolled in a law school approved by the American Bar Association;

(B) have completed legal studies amounting to at least four semesters, or the equivalent if studies are scheduled on other than a semester basis;

(C) be certified by the dean of the law school as being of good character and competent legal ability.
This certification must be filed with the Clerk and may be withdrawn at any time by the dean, upon written notice to the Clerk, or by the Court, without notice of hearing and without any showing of cause;

(D) be introduced by the attorney of record in the case;

(E) neither ask for nor receive any compensation or remuneration of any kind for his or her services from the person on whose behalf such services are rendered, but this will not prevent an attorney, legal aid bureau, law school, a state, or the United States from paying compensation to the eligible law student, nor will it prevent any agency from making such charges for its services as it may otherwise properly require;

(F) certify in writing that he or she has read and is familiar with the code of professional responsibility or rules of professional conduct in effect in the state or jurisdiction in which the student's law school is located.

(g) Self-representation.
Any appellant, petitioner, or intervenor may be self-represented before the Court.

“This Court's Rules of Practice and Procedure, as changed effective May 1, 1999, permit a limited appearance by a practitioner only for the purpose of filing a Notice of Appeal.
It is

“ORDERED that, notwithstanding the foregoing restriction, a staff attorney of a pro bono representation program operating under a grant or contract made in connection with the authority first provided in Public Law No. 102–229 may enter a limited appearance for the purpose of case screening and referral.”

Unless otherwise ordered, the appellant's principal brief shall be served and filed within 25 days after the date of the Clerk's notice that the record on appeal has been filed.

If expedited proceedings are ordered, any motion for supplementation of the record on appeal must be served and filed before the date on which the appellant's brief is due.
See also Rule 11(b). Such supplementation does not extend the time for filing any brief.

Rule 48. Disclosure of Certain Protected Records

(a) If, during the time periods set out in Rule 10 or at any other time during a proceeding before the Court, the parties identify records protected by 38 U.S.C. §7332 and at least one of the parties believes that disclosure of such records is required in such proceeding and, further, the parties cannot agree with respect to the disclosure of such records, the party requesting disclosure shall make immediate application therefor, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. §7332(b)(2)(D), caption the case “In re: Sealed Case No. [insert Court of Veterans Appeals case number]” (not disclosing the identity of any individual), and serve on the protected patient or subject or successor in interest a copy of the application.
Such application must include a statement specifying those steps taken by the parties to reach agreement before application was made to the Court.
Upon receipt of such application, the Clerk, unless otherwise ordered by the Court, shall enter the case as “withdrawn” on the docket, assign a new case number and recaption the case using an encoded identifier, and seal the record on appeal and the file of the Court.
Thereafter, any party or representative of a party, unless otherwise ordered by the Court, shall refer any subsequent filing only to the new case number and caption assigned by the Clerk.
