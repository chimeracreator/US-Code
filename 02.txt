Committee Order No. 31  

Resolved, that effective April 1, 1977, until otherwise provided by order of the Committee on House Administration, each Member, Delegate or Resident Commissioner of the House of Representatives may compensate employees from the clerk-hire allowance at a per annum rate equivalent to, and not to exceed, the highest per annum rate of basic pay, as in effect from time to time, authorized for Level V of the Executive Schedule (5 U.S.C. 5316).  

To Accompany Committee Order No. 31  

This order will tie the maximum annual rate of compensation which may be paid from the clerk-hire allowance to the Executive Schedule, and will reestablish the previously existing parity between the maximum which may be paid a committee employee, and the  maximum  which  may  be  paid  a  clerk-hire  employee.  

The Order raises the ceiling from its present level of $39,600 to $47,500, which corresponds to a Level V position, but provides no additional funds to the clerk-hire allowance.
If a Member desires to raise an employee's salary, it must be done from the existing allowance.  

This action is clearly within the Committee's authority under 2 U.S.C. 57 as modified by H.Res. 1372 (P.L. 94–440) [2 U.S.C. 57a], because it sets a “term or condition” of an allowance, and does not fix or adjust the amount of an allowance, which action would require a vote on the House floor.

Committee Order No. 38  

Resolved, That effective August 1, 1985, until otherwise provided by the Committee on House Administration, the Clerk-Hire Allowance and the Official Expenses Allowance are adjusted as follows:  

Each session a member may allocate not to exceed $40,000 from the basic Clerk-Hire Allowance which may be used to supplement the Official Expenses Allowance, and may allocate not to exceed $40,000 from the Official Expenses Allowance to supplement the basic Clerk-Hire Allowance, provided however that monthly Clerk-Hire disbursements may not exceed 10% of the basic Clerk-Hire Allowance.

All disbursements and allocations shall be made in accordance with rules and regulations established by the Committee on House Administration.

§61–1. Gross rate of compensation of employees paid by Secretary of Senate

(a) Annual rate; certification

(1) Whenever the rate of compensation of any employee whose compensation is disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate is fixed or adjusted on or after October 1, 1980, such rate as so fixed or adjusted shall be at a single whole dollar per annum gross rate and may not include a fractional part of a dollar.

(2) New or changed rates of compensation (other than changes in rates which are made by law) of any such employee (other than an employee who is an elected officer of the Senate) shall be certified in writing to the Disbursing Office of the Senate (and, for purposes of this paragraph, a new rate of compensation refers to compensation in the case of an appointment, transfer from one Senate appointing authority to another, or promotion by an appointing authority to a position the compensation for which is fixed by law). In the case of an appointment or other new rate of compensation, the certification must be received by such office on or before the day the rate of new compensation is to become effective.
In any other case, the changed rate of compensation shall take effect on the first day of the month in which such certification is received (if such certification is received within the first ten days of such month), on the first day of the month after the month in which such certification is received (if the day on which such certification is received is after the twenty-fifth day of the month in which it is received), and on the sixteenth day of the month in which such certification is received (if such certification is received after the tenth day and before the twenty-sixth day of such month). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the certification for a changed rate of compensation for an employee specifies an effective date of such change, such change shall become effective on the date so specified, but only if the date so specified is the first or sixteenth day of a month and is after the effective date prescribed in the preceding sentence; and, notwithstanding such sentence and the preceding provisions of this sentence, any changed rate of compensation for a new employee or an employee transferred from one appointing authority to another shall take effect on the date of such employee's appointment or transfer (as the case may be) if such date is later than the effective date for such changed rate of compensation as prescribed by such sentence.

(b) Conversion; increase in compensation

The rate of compensation of each employee whose compensation is disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate which was fixed before August 1, 1967, at a basic rate with respect to which additional compensation is payable by law shall be converted as of such date to the lowest per annum gross rate which is a multiple of $180 and which is not less than the aggregate rate of compensation (basic compensation plus additional compensation provided by law) which such employee was receiving immediately prior to such date.
Any increments of longevity compensation to which an employee became entitled prior to August 1, 1967, under section 60j(b) of this title shall be excluded in converting such employee's rate of compensation under this subsection, but such employee's rate of gross compensation shall be increased by $540 (which shall be considered to be an increase under section 60j(b) of this title) for each such increment.

(c) Reference in other provisions to basic rates and additional compensation as reference to per annum gross rate

In any case in which the rate of compensation of any employee or position, or class of employees or positions, the compensation for which is disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate, or any maximum or minimum rate with respect to any such employee, position, or class, is referred to in or provided by statute or Senate resolution, and the rate so referred to or provided is a basic rate with respect to which additional compensation is provided by law, such statutory provision or resolution shall be deemed to refer, in lieu of such basic rate, to the per annum gross rate which an employee receiving such basic rate immediately prior to August 1, 1967, would receive (without regard to such statutory provision or resolution) under subsection (b) of this section on and after such date.

Such master in chancery, upon receiving a copy of the order of such committee, signed by its chairman, setting forth the time and place when and where such examination is to be had, the questions to be investigated, and, so far as may be known to the committee, the names of the witnesses to be examined on the part of the United States, and the general nature of the books, papers, and documents to be proved, if known, shall proceed to give to such private parties reasonable notice of the time and place of such examination, unless such notice shall have been or shall be given by such committee or its chairman, or by the attorney or agent of the United States, or waived by such private party.
And such master shall issue subpoenas for such witnesses as may have been named in the order of such committee, and such others as the agent or other representative of the United States hereinafter mentioned shall request.
And he shall also issue subpoenas at the request of such private party, or parties, for such witnesses within such judicial district as they may desire: Provided, That the United States shall not be liable for the fees of any officer for serving any subpoena for any private party, nor for the fees of any witness on behalf of such party.
Said committee may inform the United States attorney for the district where the testimony is to be taken of the time, place, and object of such examination, and request his attendance in behalf of the Government in conducting such examination, in which case it shall be his duty to attend in person, or by an assistant employed by him, to conduct such examination on the part of the United States, or such committee may, at its option, appoint an agent or attorney, or one of its own members, for that purpose, as they may deem best; and in that event, if the committee shall not be unanimous, the minority of the committee may also appoint such agent or attorney or member of such committee to attend and take part in such examination.

Salary Recommendations for 1989 Increases

Transmitted to Congress Jan. 9, 1989

H.Doc.
No. 101–21, Cong.
Rec., vol. 135, pt. 1, p. 251, Jan. 19, 1989

Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:) 1

As required by section 225 of the Federal Salary Act of 1967, Public Law 90–206 (2 U.S.C. 351 et seq.), the latest Quadrennial Commission on Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Salaries (“Commission”) has submitted to me recommendations on salaries for Senators, Representatives, Federal judges, Cabinet officers, and other agency heads, and certain other officials in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.

The statute requires that, in the budget next submitted after receipt of the report of the Commission, I set forth recommendations for adjustment of these salaries.
Pursuant to section 225(i), as amended by section 135 of Public Law 99–190 [2 U.S.C. 359], these recommendations will be effective unless Congress disapproves the recommendation by a joint resolution within 30 days following the transmittal of my budget.

The Commission's report, submitted to me on December 14, 1988, documented both the substantial erosion in the real level of Federal executive pay that has occurred since 1969 and the recruitment and retention problems that have resulted, especially for the Federal judiciary.
The Commission is to be commended for its diligent and conscientious effort to address the complicated and complex problems associated with Federal pay levels.

The Commission found that Federal executives and legislators have experienced a decline of approximately 35 percent in real salaries since 1969. In contrast, the salaries of General Schedule employees have declined by only 8 percent over the same period.
The Commission's recommendations go a long way towards compensating for this salary erosion, but they do not make up the full gap.
For example, for an official at Executive Level II, which is also the Congressional salary rate, the salary level adjusted for inflation since 1969 would be $140,340, while the Commission's recommendation is $135,000.

Every one of the Commissions that has met over the past 20 years concluded that a pay increase for key Federal officials was necessary.
Each Commission found that pay for senior Government officials fell far behind that of their counterparts in the private sector.
They also surmised that we cannot afford a Government composed primarily of those wealthy enough to serve.

In accepting the Commission's salary recommendations, I recognize that we are under a mandate to reduce the Federal deficit and hold the costs of Government to an absolute minimum.
Thus, while I have decided to propose a pay increase that accepts in full the salary recommendations made by the Commissioners in their report to me last month, this proposal will not increase the deficit; the funding for the pay increase will be fully absorbed within proposed budget levels.

This increase fulfills my promise made in January 1987, that, assuming continued progress toward eliminating the deficit and favorable economic conditions, I would recommend another step toward overcoming the erosion of real income.

While this represents a substantial increase in salaries, it is coupled with the salutary recommendation of a ban on receipt of all honoraria in all branches of Government.
Although my recommendation concerning honoraria has no legal effect, I urge the swiftest possible consideration of this important reform.
The Commission further recommended that Congress enact legislation to bar officials in the three branches from receiving honoraria.
I endorse these recommendations of the Commission as an appropriate step toward better government.
A salary increase and a prohibition on receipt of honoraria together will help ensure that the Government is able to attract and keep talented senior officials and that the questions that arise from outside payments of honoraria are put to rest.

Accordingly, pursuant to subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (D) of section 225(f) and section 225(h) of Public Law 90–206 (81 Stat. 643 and 644), as amended [2 U.S.C. 356(A)–(D), 358] [this section]:

Disapproval of Salary Recommendations for 1989 Increases

Pub. L. 101–1, Feb. 7, 1989, 102 Stat. 3, provided: “That the Congress disapproves in their entirety the recommendations transmitted to the Congress by the President on January 9, 1989, under section 225(h) of the Federal Salary Act of 1967.”

Salary Recommendations for 1987 Increases

Transmitted to Congress Jan. 5, 1987

52 F.R. 4125; 101 Stat. 1967

Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:) 1

As required by Section 225 of the Federal Salary Act of 1967, Public Law 90–206, (2 U.S.C. 351 et seq.), the latest Quadrennial Commission on Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Salaries (“Quad Commission”) has submitted to me recommendations on salaries for Senators, Representatives, Federal judges, Cabinet officers, and other agency heads, and certain other officials in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.

The statute requires that, in the budget next submitted after receipt of the report of the Commission, I set forth recommendations for adjustment of these salaries.
Pursuant to section 225(i), as amended by section 135 of Public Law 99–190 [2 U.S.C. 359], these recommendations will be effective unless Congress disapproves the recommendations by a joint resolution within 30 days following the transmittal of my budget.

As referred to in my Budget Message, I am recommending increases in executive level pay for offices and positions within the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the Federal Government.
The Quad Commission's report, submitted to me on December 15th, 1986, documented both the substantial erosion in the real level of Federal executive pay which has occurred since 1969 and the recruitment and retention problems that have resulted, especially for the Federal judiciary.
The Commission found that Federal executives and legislators have experienced a decline of over 40 percent in real income since 1969. The Quad Commission is to be commended for its diligent and conscientious effort to address the complicated and complex problems associated with Federal pay levels.

Every one of the Quad Commissions that has met over the past 18 years concluded that a pay increase for key Federal officials was necessary.
Each Commission found that pay for senior government officials fell far behind that of their counterparts in the private sector.
They also surmised that we cannot afford a Government composed primarily of those wealthy enough to serve.
Unfortunately, the last major Quad Commission pay adjustment was in 1977—a decade ago.

In considering the Quad Commission's recommendations, I recognize that we are under a mandate to reduce the Federal deficit and hold the costs of government to an absolute minimum.
In this environment, I do not believe that we can overcome the erosion of real income since 1969 of these senior government officials in one step and thus do not believe it would be appropriate to fully implement the Quad Commission's recommendations at this time.

Accordingly, I have decided to propose a pay increase, but have cut substantially the recommendations made by the Quad Commissioners in their report to me last month.
This increase is but the first step in addressing the loss of real income documented by the Quad Commission.
In addition to this pay raise, I anticipate submitting another salary recommendation prior to leaving office—in response to the recommendations of the next Quad Commission, which will be appointed and will make its recommendations in 1988. While I cannot pre-judge those recommendations, assuming continued progress toward eliminating the deficit and favorable economic conditions, I would expect to recommend at that time another step toward overcoming that erosion of real income.

Moreover, I have decided to establish a Career Manager Pay Commission to review and report to me by next August on appropriate pay scales for our elite corps of career Government managers—those technically not included in the Quad Commission's mandate.
The pay increases I am now proposing to Congress, together with responses to the recommendations of the new Career Manager Pay Commission and the next Quad Commission, are intended to constitute a significant advancement toward placing Government compensation on a fairer and more comparable footing.

Accordingly, pursuant to subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E) of subsection (f) of section 225(h) of Public Law 90–206 (81 Stat. 644) [2 U.S.C. 356(A)–(E), 358]:

1 Editorial note: This is the text of identical letters addressed to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate, which were transmitted on January 5, 1987. The recommendations are effective at the beginning of the first day of the first pay period which begins for such office or position after the end of the thirty day period for congressional consideration (2 U.S.C. 359). The text is published in accordance with 2 U.S.C. 361.

2 Editorial note: This is the text of identical letters addressed to William D. Ford, Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, and John Glenn, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs.

January 23, 1987

Dear Mr. Chairman:

As you undoubtedly realize, the recommendations for Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Salaries accompanying the Fiscal Year 1988 Budget erroneously included one category of position that is no longer directly subject to the quadrennial review process.
Under section 1556 of Public Law 99–514, the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Special Trial Judges of the Tax Court no longer have their pay set directly under the quadrennial review process, but are instead paid 90 percent of the salary paid to judges of the Tax Court, a position that does remain under the quadrennial review process.
Thus, the inclusion of these positions in the report can be ignored since it was erroneous and of no force and effect.

Under the President's executive pay recommendations, the Tax Court Judges would be paid $89,500; the Tax Court's Special Trial Judges would consequently be paid $80,550, rather than the amount shown in the executive pay message ($72,500).

Sincerely yours,

James C. Miller III,

Director.

Disapproval of Salary Recommendations for 1987 Increases

Pub. L. 100–6, §3, Feb. 12, 1987, 101 Stat. 94, provided that: “The recommendations of the President relating to rates of pay for offices and positions within the purview of section 225(f) of the Federal Salary Act of 1967 [2 U.S.C. 356], as included (pursuant to section 225(h) of such Act [2 U.S.C. 358]) in the budget transmitted to the Congress for fiscal year 1988, are disapproved.”

[The recommendations became effective pursuant to section 359 of this title.]

Salary Recommendations for 1981 Increases

Transmitted to Congress Jan. 7, 1981

H.Doc.
No. 97–6, Cong.
Rec., vol. 127, pt. 1, p. 241, Jan. 9, 1981

To the Congress of the United States:

If the Federal Government is to meet successfully the enormous challenges it faces in these difficult times, it must be able to attract and retain men and women of outstanding ability and experience for its highest posts.

Monetary awards are not the principal attractions offered by the public service, and complete parity with private sector salaries is neither desirable nor possible.
Those who serve at the highest levels of the Federal Government expect and are willing to make some financial sacrifice to serve their country.
Nevertheless, compensation levels today have fallen below the point at which they provide adequate monetary recognition of the complexity and importance of top Federal jobs.

The financial sacrifice demanded of top Federal officials is becoming far too great.
Since the last quadrennial adjustment in 1977, the salaries of those officials have increased only 5.5 percent.
During that same period, the CPI has risen by about 45 percent, which means that the purchasing power of these salaries has declined by about 28 percent.

I fully recognize that the salaries already being paid these officials look very large to the average taxpayer.
But when we are seeking to fill an Assistant Secretary position, a Bureau Chief position, or one of the other top level policymaking positions in the Executive Branch, we want people who know the specialized field involved and who have had extensive experience and success in it.
Usually, these people are already being highly paid, and there is a limit to the financial sacrifices they can afford to make.

Not only is the discrepancy between private sector executive pay large now; it is continuing to widen.
Since 1977, for example, while Federal executive pay has risen only 5.5 percent, private sector executive pay has gone up about 25 percent.
If this gap continues to widen, government service will be so unattractive that increasing numbers of the best qualified will refuse to serve.

These observations apply equally to the selection of judges.
The Federal judiciary has traditionally drawn a substantial number of appointees from the top echelons of the legal profession.
These individuals are mature, experienced, and often at the height of their career earnings.
When they become judges, it is usually at a financial sacrifice.
If the sacrifice we ask becomes too great, increasing numbers of those best qualified will refuse consideration for appointment.
The Attorney General tells me we are already receiving many declinations from lawyers of the quality we desire.
We must not allow that trend to accelerate.

In addition to the recruiting problem, there are important considerations of retention and of equity.
Resignations from the Federal bench show a disturbing tendency: only seven Federal judges resigned in the 1950's, and eight in the 1960's; but 24 resigned in the 1970's. Three resigned in 1980 alone.

The Constitution wisely provided that Federal judges would be appointed for life.
The founders believed, and experience has confirmed, that lifetime service enhances the integrity and independence of a judge's performance.
It also strengthens public confidence that judges possess these qualities, and increases public respect for their decisions.
When lifetime judges leave the bench because of inadequate salaries, the public loses more than their experience and efficiency.
The public also loses the confidence in the judicial process that is central to the success of our Constitutional system.

Obviously, many judges will not leave the bench even for the much larger salaries they could earn by returning to private practice.
But the devotion of these judges should not be rewarded by unfair treatment.
Something must be done to encourage and reward continuous judicial service.

Turning now to career executives, you know that Executive Levels IV and V [5 U.S.C. 5315 and 5316] are by law the ceiling for career salaries.
You know also that General Schedule salaries have risen by 31.9 percent over the period in which executive salaries rose by only 5.5 percent.
As a result, more and more GS employees each year reach the executive pay ceiling.

Consequently, we now have a salary system in which up to seven levels of career executives and managers are all receiving the same pay.
Career executives who are promoted to more responsible and demanding positions often receive no pay increase whatsoever to compensate them for taking on heavier responsibilities.
Agencies with field organizations, which need to advance successful managers from district offices to regional offices to headquarters offices find it increasingly difficult to persuade capable employees to move their families for “promotions” that carry no pay increase.

One result of this compression is that many experienced and valuable career executives are retiring as quickly as they become eligible for retirement.
For the twelve month period ending last March, a startling 75 percent of career executives in the 55–59 age bracket who were at the executive pay ceiling and were eligible to retire, did so.
The result is that talented, experienced and creative public servants are leaving when they are of maximum value to their agencies.
Unless these trends are reversed, the nation cannot expect to retain a high quality senior career group.

Congress shares many of these salary problems.
We all know that people do not run for office because of the salaries involved, and that many people would run for Congress even if the members drew no pay at all.
But it is of vital importance to have Congressional salaries high enough to attract a broad range of people, including those who want their families to enjoy the same standard of living they would if they were carrying even moderately comparable responsibilities in other occupations.

Congressional salaries have experienced the same loss of purchasing power as those already discussed.
Yet, Congressmen face even greater expense than the other groups because they must maintain two residences and have other expenses stemming from their unique responsibilities.
So they, too, need pay increases.

As the law provides, a Commission on Executive, Legislative and Judicial Salaries has considered these and related salary issues.
This Commission, which was composed of distinguished private citizens with no selfish interests in Federal pay scales, made the findings I have summarized above.
To correct them, it has unanimously recommended salary increases averaging about 40 percent.

I have no doubt that the facts fully justify those recommendations.
Nevertheless, I continue to be concerned that we balance compensation needs against Federal Government leadership in fighting inflation and in minimizing the overall costs of government.
Consequently, I am recommending to you in my budget for fiscal year 1982 that smaller increases be allowed at this time, but—just as importantly—that we commit ourselves to allowing future increases annually to prevent these salary problems from continuing to worsen.

As you know, General Schedule employees received increases in fiscal year 1979 and fiscal year 1980 that totaled 16.8 percent.
By operation of Public Law 94–82 [see Short Title of 1975 Amendment note set out under 5 U.S.C. 5312], the legal salaries of top level officials also increased by these same amounts.
Congress, with my concurrence, enacted appropriation language that temporarily prohibited the payment of those increases to the top officials.
Consequently, their payable salaries are now 16.8 percent below their legal salaries.
Several judges sued over the application of that appropriation limitation to the judiciary and recently won a Supreme Court decision that means many judges will receive the 16.8 percent in question.

I believe the least we can do at this point is to give the Executive and Legislative branch officials the 16.8 percent already received by most General Schedule employees and already won by the judges.
Just as important as the immediate increase, however, is adoption of the principle that we will allow whatever increase is granted General Schedule employees in October of 1981 and in subsequent years to be paid also to the top level officials, as Public Law 94–82 [see Short Title of 1975 Amendment note set out under 5 U.S.C. 5312] provides.
Only by following this principle can we prevent the salary muddle from becoming worse every year.
Experience has shown that if we wait four years to make salary adjustments in a time of rapid inflation, the needed catch-up will be so large as to be unacceptable to out [our] citizens.

Because the case for a significant increase in the salaries of Federal judges is especially strong, I urge also that Congress give consideration to a salary scale for judges that would explicitly recognize the public importance of continuous judicial service; for example, by an annual or periodic increase for longevity in addition to the cost of living adjustments that are made from time to time.

In addition, I urge that Congress give careful consideration to the five non-salary recommendations made by the Commission, especially their proposal for a special two year study of the complex and harmful compensation problems that now exist.

The Commission concluded that the conditions I have outlined constitute “. . . a quiet crisis, unperceived by most citizens of the nation but requiring an immediate response by the President and the Congress to safeguard the high quality of its senior officials.” I agree with that conclusion and urge you to act favorably upon my recommendations.
President-elect Reagan has authorized me to say that he fully supports these recommendations.

Public Law 95–16 [probably should be 95–19, title IV, §401(a), Apr. 12, 1977, 91 Stat. 45, which amended section 356 of this title] provides that each House must within 60 days conduct a separate recorded vote on my recommendations for each branch of government.
In addition, if you wish to accept my recommendation to make the current legal rates payable now, you should amend section 101(c) of Public Law 96–536 [Dec. 16, 1980, 94 Stat. 3167] accordingly.

In the event that you decide you do not wish to approve increases for your own Members, I strongly urge that you allow them for officials of the Executive and Judicial branches.
The gravity of the “quiet crisis” those branches face requires you to do no less.

Jimmy Carter.

Within 5 days after receipt of a complaint, the Commission shall notify, in writing, any person alleged in the complaint to have committed such a violation.
Before the Commission conducts any vote on the complaint, other than a vote to dismiss, any person so notified shall have the opportunity to demonstrate, in writing, to the Commission within 15 days after notification that no action should be taken against such person on the basis of the complaint.
The Commission may not conduct any investigation or take any other action under this section solely on the basis of a complaint of a person whose identity is not disclosed to the Commission.

(2) If the Commission, upon receiving a complaint under paragraph (1) or on the basis of information ascertained in the normal course of carrying out its supervisory responsibilities, determines, by an affirmative vote of 4 of its members, that it has reason to believe that a person has committed, or is about to commit, a violation of this Act or chapter 95 or chapter 96 of title 26, the Commission shall, through its chairman or vice chairman, notify the person of the alleged violation.
Such notification shall set forth the factual basis for such alleged violation.
The Commission shall make an investigation of such alleged violation, which may include a field investigation or audit, in accordance with the provisions of this section.

(3) The general counsel of the Commission shall notify the respondent of any recommendation to the Commission by the general counsel to proceed to a vote on probable cause pursuant to paragraph (4)(A)(i). With such notification, the general counsel shall include a brief stating the position of the general counsel on the legal and factual issues of the case.
Within 15 days of receipt of such brief, respondent may submit a brief stating the position of such respondent on the legal and factual issues of the case, and replying to the brief of general counsel.
Such briefs shall be filed with the Secretary of the Commission and shall be considered by the Commission before proceeding under paragraph (4).

(4)(A)(i) Except as provided in clause (ii), if the Commission determines, by an affirmative vote of 4 of its members, that there is probable cause to believe that any person has committed, or is about to commit, a violation of this Act or of chapter 95 or chapter 96 of title 26, the Commission shall attempt, for a period of at least 30 days, to correct or prevent such violation by informal methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion, and to enter into a conciliation agreement with any person involved.
Such attempt by the Commission to correct or prevent such violation may continue for a period of not more than 90 days.
The Commission may not enter into a conciliation agreement under this clause except pursuant to an affirmative vote of 4 of its members.
A conciliation agreement, unless violated, is a complete bar to any further action by the Commission, including the bringing of a civil proceeding under paragraph (6)(A).

(ii) If any determination of the Commission under clause (i) occurs during the 45-day period immediately preceding any election, then the Commission shall attempt, for a period of at least 15 days, to correct or prevent the violation involved by the methods specified in clause (i).

(B)(i) No action by the Commission or any person, and no information derived, in connection with any conciliation attempt by the Commission under subparagraph (A) may be made public by the Commission without the written consent of the respondent and the Commission.

If the Commission makes a determination that a person has not violated this Act or chapter 95 or chapter 96 of title 26, the Commission shall make public such determination.

(5)(A) If the Commission believes that a violation of this Act or of chapter 95 or chapter 96 of title 26 has been committed, a conciliation agreement entered into by the Commission under paragraph (4)(A) may include a requirement that the person involved in such conciliation agreement shall pay a civil penalty which does not exceed the greater of $5,000 or an amount equal to any contribution or expenditure involved in such violation.

(B) If the Commission believes that a knowing and willful violation of this Act or of chapter 95 or chapter 96 of title 26 has been committed, a conciliation agreement entered into by the Commission under paragraph (4)(A) may require that the person involved in such conciliation agreement shall pay a civil penalty which does not exceed the greater of $10,000 or an amount equal to 200 percent of any contribution or expenditure involved in such violation.

(C) If the Commission by an affirmative vote of 4 of its members, determines that there is probable cause to believe that a knowing and willful violation of this Act which is subject to subsection (d) of this section, or a knowing and willful violation of chapter 95 or chapter 96 of title 26, has occurred or is about to occur, it may refer such apparent violation to the Attorney General of the United States without regard to any limitations set forth in paragraph (4)(A).

(D) In any case in which a person has entered into a conciliation agreement with the Commission under paragraph (4)(A), the Commission may institute a civil action for relief under paragraph (6)(A) if it believes that the person has violated any provision of such conciliation agreement.

(6)(A) If the Commission is unable to correct or prevent any violation of this Act or of chapter 95 or chapter 96 of title 26, by the methods specified in paragraph (4)(A), the Commission may, upon an affirmative vote of 4 of its members, institute a civil action for relief, including a permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order, or any other appropriate order (including an order for a civil penalty which does not exceed the greater of $5,000 or an amount equal to any contribution or expenditure involved in such violation) in the district court of the United States for the district in which the person against whom such action is brought is found, resides, or transacts business.

(C) In any civil action for relief instituted by the Commission under subparagraph (A), if the court determines that the Commission has established that the person involved in such civil action has committed a knowing and willful violation of this Act or of chapter 95 or chapter 96 of title 26, the court may impose a civil penalty which does not exceed the greater of $10,000 or an amount equal to 200 percent of any contribution or expenditure involved in such violation.

(7) In any action brought under paragraph (5) or (6), subpenas for witnesses who are required to attend a United States district court may run into any other district.

(8)(A) Any party aggrieved by an order of the Commission dismissing a complaint filed by such party under paragraph (1), or by a failure of the Commission to act on such complaint during the 120-day period beginning on the date the complaint is filed, may file a petition with the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.

(B) Any petition under subparagraph (A) shall be filed, in the case of a dismissal of a complaint by the Commission, within 60 days after the date of the dismissal.

(9) Any judgment of a district court under this subsection may be appealed to the court of appeals, and the judgment of the court of appeals affirming or setting aside, in whole or in part, any such order of the district court shall be final, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification as provided in section 1254 of title 28.

(3) In any criminal action brought for a violation of any provision of this Act or of chapter 95 or chapter 96 of title 26, the court before which such action is brought shall take into account, in weighing the seriousness of the violation and in considering the appropriateness of the penalty to be imposed if the defendant is found guilty, whether—

§471. Congressional findings and declaration of purpose

The Congress hereby finds and declares that:

(a) As technology continues to change and expand rapidly, its applications are—

(1) large and growing in scale; and

(2) increasingly extensive, pervasive, and critical in their impact, beneficial and adverse, on the natural and social environment.

(b) Therefore, it is essential that, to the fullest extent possible, the consequences of technological applications be anticipated, understood, and considered in determination of public policy on existing and emerging national problems.

(c) The Congress further finds that:

(1) the Federal agencies presently responsible directly to the Congress are not designed to provide the legislative branch with adequate and timely information, independently developed, relating to the potential impact of technological applications, and

(2) the present mechanisms of the Congress do not and are not designed to provide the legislative branch with such information.

(d) Accordingly, it is necessary for the Congress to—

(1) equip itself with new and effective means for securing competent, unbiased information concerning the physical, biological, economic, social, and political effects of such applications; and

(2) utilize this information, whenever appropriate, as one factor in the legislative assessment of matters pending before the Congress, particularly in those instances where the Federal Government may be called upon to consider support for, or management or regulation of, technological applications.

(Pub. L. 92–484, §2, Oct. 13, 1972, 86 Stat. 797.)

§633. Committee allocations

(a) Allocation of totals

(1) For the House of Representatives, the joint explanatory statement accompanying a conference report on a concurrent resolution on the budget shall include an estimated allocation, based upon such concurrent resolution as recommended in such conference report, of the appropriate levels of total budget outlays, total new budget authority, and total entitlement authority among each committee of the House of Representatives which has jurisdiction over laws, bills and resolutions providing such new budget authority,1 or such entitlement authority.
The allocation shall, for each committee, divide new budget authority,1 and entitlement authority between amounts provided or required by law on the date of such conference report (mandatory or uncontrollable amounts), and amounts not so provided or required (discretionary or controllable amounts), and shall make the same division for estimated outlays that would result from such new budget authority.

(2) For the Senate, the joint explanatory statement accompanying a conference report on a concurrent resolution on the budget shall include an estimated allocation, based upon such concurrent resolution as recommended in such conference report, of the appropriate levels of social security outlays for the fiscal year of the resolution and for each of the 4 succeeding fiscal years, total budget outlays and total new budget authority among each committee of the Senate which has jurisdiction over bills and resolutions providing such new budget authority.

(b) Reports by committees

As soon as practicable after a concurrent resolution on the budget is agreed to—

(1) the Committee on Appropriations of each House shall, after consulting with the Committee on Appropriations of the other House, (A) subdivide among its subcommittees the allocation of budget outlays and new budget authority allocated to it in the joint explanatory statement accompanying the conference report on such concurrent resolution, and (B) further subdivide the amount with respect to each such subcommittee between controllable amounts and all other amounts; and

(2) every other committee of the House and Senate to which an allocation was made in such joint explanatory statement shall, after consulting with the committee or committees of the other House to which all or part of its allocation was made, (A) subdivide such allocation among its subcommittees or among programs over which it has jurisdiction, and (B) further subdivide the amount with respect to each subcommittee or program between controllable amounts and all other amounts.

Each such committee shall promptly report to its House the subdivisions made by it pursuant to this subsection.

(c) Point of order

It shall not be in order in the House of Representatives or the Senate to consider any bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report, providing—

(1) new budget authority for a fiscal year; or

(2) new spending authority as described in section 651(c)(2) of this title for a fiscal year;

within the jurisdiction of any committee which has received an appropriate allocation of such authority pursuant to subsection (a) of this section for such fiscal year, unless and until such committee makes the allocation or subdivisions required by subsection (b) of this section, in connection with the most recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget for such fiscal year.

(d) Subsequent concurrent resolutions

In the case of a concurrent resolution on the budget referred to in section 635 of this title, the allocations under subsection (a) of this section and the subdivisions under subsection (b) of this section shall be required only to the extent necessary to take into account revisions made in the most recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget.

(e) Alteration of allocations

At any time after a committee reports the allocations required to be made under subsection (b) of this section, such committee may report to its House an alteration of such allocations.
Any alteration of such allocations must be consistent with any actions already taken by its House on legislation within the committee's jurisdiction.

(f) Legislation subject to point of order

(1) In the House of Representatives

After the Congress has completed action on a concurrent resolution on the budget for a fiscal year, it shall not be in order in the House of Representatives to consider any bill, joint resolution, or amendment providing new budget authority for such fiscal year or new entitlement authority effective during such fiscal year, or any conference report on any such bill or joint resolution, if—

(A) the enactment of such bill or resolution as reported;

(B) the adoption and enactment of such amendment; or

(C) the enactment of such bill or resolution in the form recommended in such conference report,

would cause the appropriate allocation made pursuant to subsection (b) of this section for such fiscal year of new discretionary budget authority or new entitlement authority to be exceeded.

(2) In the Senate

At any time after the Congress has completed action on the concurrent resolution on the budget required to be reported under section 632(a) of this title for a fiscal year, it shall not be in order in the Senate to consider any bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report, that provides for budget outlays, new budget authority, or new spending authority (as defined in section 651(c)(2) of this title) in excess of (A) the appropriate allocation of such outlays or authority reported under subsection (a) of this section, or (B) the appropriate allocation (if any) of such outlays or authority reported under subsection (b) of this section in connection with the most recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget for such fiscal year or provides for social security outlays in excess of the appropriate allocation of social security outlays under subsection (a) of this section for the fiscal year of the resolution or for the total of that year and the 4 succeeding fiscal years.
Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any bill, resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report that is within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Appropriations.
In applying this paragraph—

(A) estimated social security outlays shall be deemed to be reduced by the excess of estimated social security revenues (including social security revenues provided for in the bill, resolution, amendment, or conference report with respect to which this paragraph is applied) over the appropriate level of social security revenues specified in the most recently adopted concurrent resolution on the budget;

(B) estimated social security outlays shall be deemed increased by the shortfall of estimated social security revenues (including social security revenues provided for in the bill, resolution, amendment, or conference report with respect to which this paragraph is applied) below the appropriate level of social security revenues specified in the most recently adopted concurrent resolution on the budget; and

(C) no provision of any bill or resolution, or any amendment thereto or conference report thereon, involving a change in chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.] shall be treated as affecting the amount of social security revenues unless such provision changes the income tax treatment of social security benefits.

The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate may file with the Senate appropriately revised allocations under subsection (a) of this section and revised functional levels and aggregates to reflect the application of the preceding sentence.
Such revised allocations, functional levels, and aggregates shall be considered as allocations, functional levels, and aggregates contained in the most recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget, and the appropriate committees shall report revised allocations pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.

(g) Determinations by Budget Committees

For purposes of this section, the levels of new budget authority, spending authority as described in section 651(c)(2) of this title, outlays, and new credit authority for a fiscal year shall be determined on the basis of estimates made by the Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives or the Senate, as the case may be.

(2) It shall not be in order in the Senate to consider any amendment to a reconciliation bill or reconciliation resolution if such amendment would have the effect of decreasing any specific budget outlay reductions below the level of such outlay reductions provided (for the fiscal years covered) in the reconciliation instructions which relate to such bill or resolution set forth in a resolution providing for reconciliation, or would have the effect of reducing Federal revenue increases below the level of such revenue increases provided (for such fiscal years) in such instructions relating to such bill or resolution, unless such amendment makes a reduction in other specific budget outlays, an increase in other specific Federal revenues, or a combination thereof (for such fiscal years) at least equivalent to any increase in outlays or decrease in revenues provided by such amendment, except that a motion to strike a provision shall always be in order.

(3) Paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply if a declaration of war by the Congress is in effect.

(4) For purposes of this section, the levels of budget outlays and Federal revenues for a fiscal year shall be determined on the basis of estimates made by the Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives or of the Senate, as the case may be.

§642. New budget authority, new spending authority, and revenue legislation to be within appropriate levels

(a) Legislation subject to point of order

(1) Except as provided by subsection (b) of this section, after the Congress has completed action on a concurrent resolution on the budget for a fiscal year, it shall not be in order in either the House of Representatives or the Senate to consider any bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report providing new budget authority for such fiscal year, providing new entitlement authority effective during such fiscal year, or reducing revenues for such fiscal year,,1 if—

(A) the enactment of such bill or resolution as reported;

(B) the adoption and enactment of such amendment; or

(C) the enactment of such bill or resolution in the form recommended in such conference report;

would cause the appropriate level of total new budget authority or total budget outlays set forth in the most recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget for such fiscal year to be exceeded, or would cause revenues to be less than the appropriate level of total revenues set forth in such concurrent resolution except in the case that a declaration of war by the Congress is in effect.

(2)(A) After the Congress has completed action on a concurrent resolution on the budget, it shall not be in order in the Senate to consider any bill, resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report that would cause the appropriate level of total new budget authority or total budget outlays or social security outlays set forth for the first fiscal year in the most recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget covering such fiscal year to be exceeded, or would cause revenues to be less than the appropriate level of total revenues (or social security revenues to be less than the appropriate level of social security revenues) set forth for the first fiscal year covered by the resolution and for the period including the first fiscal year plus the following 4 fiscal years in such concurrent resolution.

(B) In applying this paragraph—

(i)(I) estimated social security outlays shall be deemed to be reduced by the excess of estimated social security revenues (including those provided for in the bill, resolution, amendment, or conference report with respect to which this subsection is applied) over the appropriate level of Social Security revenues specified in the most recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget;

(II) estimated social security revenues shall be deemed to be increased to the extent that estimated social security outlays are less (taking into account the effect of the bill, resolution, amendment, or conference report to which this subsection is being applied) than the appropriate level of social security outlays in the most recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget; and

(ii)(I) estimated Social Security outlays shall be deemed to be increased by the shortfall of estimated social security revenues (including Social Security revenues provided for in the bill, resolution, amendment, or conference report with respect to which this subsection is applied) below the appropriate level of social security revenues specified in the most recently adopted concurrent resolution on the budget; and

(II) estimated social security revenues shall be deemed to be reduced by the excess of estimated social security outlays (including social security outlays provided for in the bill, resolution, amendment, or conference report with respect to which this subsection is applied) above the appropriate level of social security outlays specified in the most recently adopted concurrent resolution on the budget; and

(iii) no provision of any bill or resolution, or any amendment thereto or conference report thereon, involving a change in chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.] shall be treated as affecting the amount of social security revenues unless such provision changes the income tax treatment of social security benefits.

The chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate may file with the Senate appropriately revised allocations under section 633(a) of this title and revised functional levels and aggregates to reflect the application of the preceding sentence.
Such revised allocations, functional levels, and aggregates shall be considered as allocations, functional levels, and aggregates contained in the most recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget, and the appropriate committees shall report revised allocations pursuant to section 633(b) of this title.

(b) Exception in House

Subsection (a) of this section shall not apply in the House of Representatives to any bill, resolution, or amendment which provides new budget authority or new entitlement authority effective during such fiscal year, or to any conference report on any such bill or resolution, if—

(1) the enactment of such bill or resolution as reported;

(2) the adoption and enactment of such amendment; or

(3) the enactment of such bill or resolution in the form recommended in such conference report,

would not cause the appropriate allocation of new discretionary budget authority or new entitlement authority made pursuant to section 633(a) of this title for such fiscal year, for the committee within whose jurisdiction such bill, resolution, or amendment falls, to be exceeded.

(c) Determination of budget levels

For purposes of this section, the levels of new budget authority, budget outlays, new entitlement authority, and revenues for a fiscal year shall be determined on the basis of estimates made by the Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives or of the Senate, as the case may be.

(1)(A) Except as provided in paragraph (2), a provision of a reconciliation bill or reconciliation resolution considered pursuant to section 641 of this title shall be considered extraneous if such provision does not produce a change in outlays or revenues, including changes in outlays and revenues brought about by changes in the terms and conditions under which outlays are made or revenues are required to be collected (but a provision in which outlay decreases or revenue increases exactly offset outlay increases or revenue decreases shall not be considered extraneous by virtue of this subparagraph); (B) any provision producing an increase in outlays or decrease in revenues shall be considered extraneous if the net effect of provisions reported by the committee reporting the title containing the provision is that the committee fails to achieve its reconciliation instructions; (C) a provision that is not in the jurisdiction of the committee with jurisdiction over said title or provision shall be considered extraneous; (D) a provision shall be considered extraneous if it produces changes in outlays or revenues which are merely incidental to the non-budgetary components of the provision; (E) a provision shall be considered to be extraneous if it increases, or would increase, net outlays, or if it decreases, or would decrease, revenues during a fiscal year after the fiscal years covered by such reconciliation bill or reconciliation resolution, and such increases or decreases are greater than outlay reductions or revenue increases resulting from other provisions in such title in such year; and (F) a provision shall be considered extraneous if it violates section 641(g) of this title.

(2) A Senate-originated provision shall not be considered extraneous under paragraph (1)(A) if the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Committee on the Budget and the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Committee which reported the provision certify that: (A) the provision mitigates direct effects clearly attributable to a provision changing outlays or revenues and both provisions together produce a net reduction in the deficit; (B) the provision will result in a substantial reduction in outlays or a substantial increase in revenues during fiscal years after the fiscal years covered by the reconciliation bill or reconciliation resolution; (C) a reduction of outlays or an increase in revenues is likely to occur as a result of the provision, in the event of new regulations authorized by the provision or likely to be proposed, court rulings on pending litigation, or relationships between economic indices and stipulated statutory triggers pertaining to the provision, other than the regulations, court rulings or relationships currently projected by the Congressional Budget Office for scorekeeping purposes; or (D) such provision will be likely to produce a significant reduction in outlays or increase in revenues but, due to insufficient data, such reduction or increase cannot be reliably estimated.

(3) A provision reported by a committee shall not be considered extraneous under paragraph (1)(C) if (A) the provision is an integral part of a provision or title, which if introduced as a bill or resolution would be referred to such committee, and the provision sets forth the procedure to carry out or implement the substantive provisions that were reported and which fall within the jurisdiction of such committee; or (B) the provision states an exception to, or a special application of, the general provision or title of which it is a part and such general provision or title if introduced as a bill or resolution would be referred to such committee.

(c) 1 Point of order

When the Senate is considering a conference report on, or an amendment between the Houses in relation to, a reconciliation bill or reconciliation resolution pursuant to section 641 of this title, upon—

(1) a point of order being made by any Senator against extraneous material meeting the definition of subsections (b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(B), (b)(1)(D), (b)(1)(E), or (b)(1)(F) of this section, and

(2) such point of order being sustained,

such material contained in such conference report or amendment shall be deemed stricken, and the Senate shall proceed, without intervening action or motion, to consider the question of whether the Senate shall recede from its amendment and concur with a further amendment, or concur in the House amendment with a further amendment, as the case may be, which further amendment shall consist of only that portion of the conference report or House amendment, as the case may be, not so stricken.
Any such motion in the Senate shall be debatable for two hours.
In any case in which such point of order is sustained against a conference report (or Senate amendment derived from such conference report by operation of this subsection), no further amendment shall be in order.

(c) 1 Extraneous materials

Upon the reporting or discharge of a reconciliation bill or resolution pursuant to section 641 of this title in the Senate, and again upon the submission of a conference report on such a reconciliation bill or resolution, the Committee on the Budget of the Senate shall submit for the record a list of material considered to be extraneous under subsections (b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(B), and (b)(1)(E) of this section to the instructions of a committee as provided in this section.
The inclusion or exclusion of a provision shall not constitute a determination of extraneousness by the Presiding Officer of the Senate.

(d) General point of order

Notwithstanding any other law or rule of the Senate, it shall be in order for a Senator to raise a single point of order that several provisions of a bill, resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report violate this section.
The Presiding Officer may sustain the point of order as to some or all of the provisions against which the Senator raised the point of order.
If the Presiding Officer so sustains the point of order as to some of the provisions (including provisions of an amendment, motion, or conference report) against which the Senator raised the point of order, then only those provisions (including provisions of an amendment, motion, or conference report) against which the Presiding Officer sustains the point of order shall be deemed stricken pursuant to this section.
Before the Presiding Officer rules on such a point of order, any Senator may move to waive such a point of order as it applies to some or all of the provisions against which the point of order was raised.
Such a motion to waive is amendable in accordance with the rules and precedents of the Senate.
After the Presiding Officer rules on such a point of order, any Senator may appeal the ruling of the Presiding Officer on such a point of order as it applies to some or all of the provisions on which the Presiding Officer ruled.

(e) Determination of levels

For purposes of this section, the levels of new budget authority, budget outlays, new entitlement authority, and revenues for a fiscal year shall be determined on the basis of estimates made by the Committee on the Budget of the Senate.

If the Committee on Appropriations of either House fails to report a bill or resolution referred to it under this paragraph within such 15-day period, the committee shall automatically be discharged from further consideration of such bill or resolution and such bill or resolution shall be placed on the appropriate calendar.

Ex. Ord.
No. 12857, Aug. 4, 1993, 58 F.R. 42181, provided:

By the authority vested in me as President of the United States by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 1105 of title 31, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:

Section 1. Purpose.
The purpose of this order is to create a mechanism to monitor total costs of direct spending programs, and, in the event that actual or projected costs exceed targeted levels, to require that the budget address adjustments in direct spending.

Sec. 2. Establishment of Direct Spending Targets.

(a) In General.
The initial direct spending targets for each of fiscal years 1994 through 1997 shall equal total outlays for all direct spending except net interest and deposit insurance as determined by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (Director) under subsection (b).

(b) Initial Report by Director. (1) Not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA) [Aug. 10, 1993], the Director shall submit a report to the Congress setting forth projected direct spending targets for each of fiscal years 1994 through 1997.

(2) The Director's projections shall be based on legislation enacted as of 5 days before the report is submitted under paragraph (1). To the extent feasible, the Director shall use the same economic and technical assumptions used in preparing the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1994 (H.Con.Res. 64).

(c) Adjustments.
Direct spending targets shall be subsequently adjusted by the Director under Section 6.

Sec. 3. Annual Review of Direct Spending and Receipts by President.
As part of each budget submitted under section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code, the Director shall provide an annual review of direct spending and receipts, which shall include (1) information supporting the adjustment of direct spending targets pursuant to Section 6, (2) information on total outlays for programs covered by the direct spending targets, including actual outlays for the prior fiscal year and projected outlays for the current fiscal year and the 5 succeeding fiscal years, and (3) information on the major categories of Federal receipts, including a comparison between the levels of those receipts and the levels projected as of the date of enactment of OBRA [Aug. 10, 1993].

Sec. 4. Special Direct Spending Message by President. (a) Trigger.
In the event that the information submitted under Section 3 indicates—

(1) that actual outlays for direct spending in the prior fiscal year exceeded the applicable direct spending target, or

(2) that outlays for direct spending for the current or budget year are projected to exceed the applicable direct spending targets, the Director shall include in the budget a special direct spending message meeting the requirements of subsection (b) of this Section.

(b) Contents. (1) The special direct spending message shall include:

(A) An explanation of any adjustments to the direct spending targets pursuant to Section 6.

(B) An analysis of the variance in direct spending over the adjusted direct spending targets.

(C) The President's recommendations for addressing the direct spending overages, if any, in the prior, current, or budget year.

(2) The recommendations may consist of any of the following:

(A) Proposed legislative changes to reduce outlays, increase revenues, or both, in order to recoup or eliminate the overage for the prior, current, and budget years in the current year, the budget year, and the 4 out-years.

(B) Proposed legislative changes to reduce outlays, increase revenues, or both, in order to recoup or eliminate part of the overage for the prior, current, and budget year in the current year, the budget year, and the 4 out-years, accompanied by a finding by the President that, because of economic conditions or for other specified reasons, only some of the overage should be recouped or eliminated by outlay reductions or revenue increases, or both.

(C) A proposal to make no legislative changes to recoup or eliminate any overage, accompanied by a finding by the President that, because of economic conditions or for other specified reasons, no legislative changes are warranted.

(3) Any proposed legislative change under paragraph (2) to reduce outlays may include reductions in direct spending or in the discretionary spending limits under section 601 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 [2 U.S.C. 665].

Sec. 5. Proposed Special Direct Spending Resolution.
If the President recommends reductions consistent with subsection [Section] 4 (b)(2)(A) or (B), the special direct spending message shall include the text of a special direct spending resolution implementing the President's recommendations through reconciliation directives instructing the appropriate committees of the House of Representatives and Senate to determine and recommend changes in laws within their jurisdictions to reduce outlays or increase revenues by specified amounts.
If the President recommends no reductions pursuant to Section 4 (b)(2)(C), the special direct spending message shall include the text of a special resolution concurring in the President's recommendation of no legislative action.

Sec. 6. Adjustments to Direct Spending Targets.

(a) Required Annual Adjustments.
Prior to the submission of the President's budget for each of fiscal years 1995 through 1997, the Director shall adjust the direct spending targets in accordance with this Section.
Any such adjustments shall be reflected in the targets used in the report under Section 3 and message (if any) under Section 4.

(b) Adjustment for Increases in Beneficiaries. (1) The Director shall adjust the direct spending targets for increases (if any) in actual or projected numbers of beneficiaries under direct spending programs for which the number of beneficiaries is a variable in determining costs.

(2) The adjustment shall be made by—

(A) computing, for each program under paragraph (1), the percentage change between (i) the annual average number of beneficiaries under that program (including actual numbers of beneficiaries for the prior fiscal year and projections for the budget and subsequent fiscal years) to be used in the President's budget with which the adjustments will be submitted, and (ii) the annual average number of beneficiaries used in the adjustments made by the Director in the previous year (or, in the case of adjustments made in 1994, the annual average number of beneficiaries used in the Director's initial report under Section 2(b));

(B) applying the percentages computed under subparagraph (A) to the projected levels of outlays for each program consistent with the direct spending targets in effect immediately prior to the adjustment; and

(C) adding the results of the calculations required by subparagraph (B) to the direct spending targets in effect immediately prior to the adjustment.

(3) No adjustment shall be made for any program for a fiscal year in which the percentage increase computed under paragraph (2)(A) is less than or equal to zero.

(c) Adjustments for Revenue Legislation.
The Director shall adjust the targets as follows:

(1) they shall be increased by the amount of any increase in receipts; or

(2) they shall be decreased by the amount of any decrease in receipts, resulting from receipts legislation enacted after the date of enactment of OBRA [Aug. 10, 1993], except legislation enacted in response to the message transmitted under Section 4.

(d) Adjustments To Reflect Congressional Decisions.
Upon enactment of a reconciliation bill enacted in response to a message submitted under Section 4, the Director shall adjust direct spending targets for the current year, the budget year, and each outyear through 1997 by—

(1) increasing the target for the current year and the budget year by the amount stated for that year in that reconciliation bill (but if a separate vote was required by Congressional rules, only if that vote has occurred); and

(2) decreasing the target for the current, budget, and outyears through 1997 by the amount of reductions in direct spending enacted in that reconciliation bill.

(e) Designated Emergencies.
The Director shall adjust the targets to reflect the costs of legislation that is designated as an emergency by Congress and the President under section 252(e) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 [2 U.S.C. 902(e)].

Sec. 7. Relationship to Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act.
Recommendations pursuant to Section 4 shall include a provision specifying that reductions in outlays or increases in receipts resulting from that legislation shall not be taken into account for purposes of any budget enforcement procedures under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 [2 U.S.C. 900 et seq.].

Sec. 8. Estimating Margin.
For any fiscal year for which the overage is less than one-half of 1 percent of the direct spending target for that year, the procedures set forth in Section 4 shall not apply.

Sec. 9. Means-Tested Programs.
In making recommendations under Section 4, the Director shall seriously consider all other alternatives before proposing reductions in means-tested programs.

Sec. 10. Effective Date.
This order shall take effect upon enactment of OBRA [Aug. 10, 1993]. This order shall apply to direct spending targets for fiscal years 1994 through 1997 and shall expire at the end of fiscal year 1997.

(3) Military personnel

If the President uses the authority to exempt any military personnel from sequestration under section 905(h) of this title, each account within subfunctional category 051 (other than those military personnel accounts for which the authority provided under section 905(h) of this title has been exercised) shall be further reduced by a dollar amount calculated by multiplying the enacted level of non-exempt budgetary resources in that account at that time by the uniform percentage necessary to offset the total dollar amount by which outlays are not reduced in military personnel accounts by reason of the use of such authority.

(4) Part-year appropriations

If, on the date specified in paragraph (1), there is in effect an Act making or continuing appropriations for part of a fiscal year for any budget account, then the dollar sequestration calculated for that account under paragraphs (2) and (3) shall be subtracted from—

(A) the annualized amount otherwise available by law in that account under that or a subsequent part-year appropriation; and

(B) when a full-year appropriation for that account is enacted, from the amount otherwise provided by the full-year appropriation.

(5) Look-back

If, after June 30, an appropriation for the fiscal year in progress is enacted that causes a breach within a category for that year (after taking into account any sequestration of amounts within that category), the discretionary spending limits for that category for the next fiscal year shall be reduced by the amount or amounts of that breach.

(6) Within-session sequestration

If an appropriation for a fiscal year in progress is enacted (after Congress adjourns to end the session for that budget year and before July 1 of that fiscal year) that causes a breach within a category for that year (after taking into account any prior sequestration of amounts within that category), 15 days later there shall be a sequestration to eliminate that breach within that category following the procedures set forth in paragraphs (2) through (4).

(7) OMB estimates

As soon as practicable after Congress completes action on any discretionary appropriation, CBO, after consultation with the Committees on the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall provide OMB with an estimate of the amount of discretionary new budget authority and outlays for the current year (if any) and the budget year provided by that legislation.
Within 5 calendar days after the enactment of any discretionary appropriation, OMB shall transmit a report to the House of Representatives and to the Senate containing the CBO estimate of that legislation, an OMB estimate of the amount of discretionary new budget authority and outlays for the current year (if any) and the budget year provided by that legislation, and an explanation of any difference between the two estimates.
For purposes of this paragraph, amounts provided by annual appropriations shall include any new budget authority and outlays for those years in accounts for which funding is provided in that legislation that result from previously enacted legislation.
Those OMB estimates shall be made using current economic and technical assumptions. OMB shall use the OMB estimates transmitted to the Congress under this paragraph for the purposes of this subsection. OMB and CBO shall prepare estimates under this paragraph in conformance with scorekeeping guidelines determined after consultation among the House and Senate Committees on the Budget, CBO, and OMB.

(b) Adjustments to discretionary spending limits

(1) When the President submits the budget under section 1105(a) of title 31 for budget year 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, or 1998 (except as otherwise indicated), OMB shall calculate (in the order set forth below), and the budget shall include, adjustments to discretionary spending limits (and those limits as cumulatively adjusted) for the budget year and each outyear through 1998 to reflect the following:

(A) Changes in concepts and definitions

The adjustments produced by the amendments made by title XIII of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 or by any other changes in concepts and definitions shall equal the baseline levels of new budget authority and outlays using up-to-date concepts and definitions minus those levels using the concepts and definitions in effect before such changes.
Such other changes in concepts and definitions may only be made in consultation with the Committees on Appropriations, the Budget, Government Operations, and Governmental Affairs of the House of Representatives and Senate.

(B) Changes in inflation

(i) For a budget submitted for budget year 1992, 1993, 1994, or 1995, the adjustments produced by changes in inflation shall equal the levels of discretionary new budget authority and outlays in the baseline (calculated using current estimates) subtracted from those levels in that baseline recalculated with the baseline inflators for the budget year only, multiplied by the inflation adjustment factor computed under clause (ii).

(ii) For a budget year the inflation adjustment factor shall equal the ratio between the level of year-over-year inflation measured for the fiscal year most recently completed and the applicable estimated level for that year set forth below:

For 1990, 1.041

For 1991, 1.052

For 1992, 1.041

For 1993, 1.033

Inflation shall be measured by the average of the estimated gross national product implicit price deflator index for a fiscal year divided by the average index for the prior fiscal year.

(iii) For a budget submitted for budget year 1996, 1997, or 1998, the adjustments shall be those necessary to reflect changes in inflation estimates since those of March 31, 1993, set forth on page 46 of House Conference Report 103–48.

(C) Credit reestimates

For a budget submitted for fiscal year 1993 or 1994, the adjustments produced by reestimates to costs of Federal credit programs shall be, for any such program, a current estimate of new budget authority and outlays associated with a baseline projection of the prior year's gross loan level for that program minus the baseline projection of the prior year's new budget authority and associated outlays for that program.

(2) When OMB submits a sequestration report under section 904(g) or (h) of this title for fiscal year 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, or 1998 (except as otherwise indicated), OMB shall calculate (in the order set forth below), and the sequestration report, and subsequent budgets submitted by the President under section 1105(a) of title 31, shall include, adjustments to discretionary spending limits (and those limits as adjusted) for the fiscal year and each succeeding year through 1998, as follows:

(A) IRS funding

To the extent that appropriations are enacted that provide additional new budget authority or result in additional outlays (as compared with the CBO baseline constructed in June 1990) for the Internal Revenue Service compliance initiative in any fiscal year, the adjustments for that year shall be those amounts, but shall not exceed the amounts set forth below—

(i) for fiscal year 1991, $191,000,000 in new budget authority and $183,000,000 in outlays;

(ii) for fiscal year 1992, $172,000,000 in new budget authority and $169,000,000 in outlays;

(iii) for fiscal year 1993, $183,000,000 in new budget authority and $179,000,000 in outlays;

(iv) for fiscal year 1994, $187,000,000 in new budget authority and $183,000,000 in outlays; and

(v) for fiscal year 1995, $188,000,000 in new budget authority and $184,000,000 in outlays; and

the prior-year outlays resulting from these appropriations of budget authority.

(B) Debt forgiveness

If, in calendar year 1990 or 1991, an appropriation is enacted that forgives the Arab Republic of Egypt's foreign military sales indebtedness to the United States and any part of the Government of Poland's indebtedness to the United States, the adjustment shall be the estimated costs (in new budget authority and outlays, in all years) of that forgiveness.

(C) IMF funding

If, in fiscal year 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, or 1995 an appropriation is enacted to provide to the International Monetary Fund the dollar equivalent, in terms of Special Drawing Rights, of the increase in the United States quota as part of the International Monetary Fund Ninth General Review of Quotas, the adjustment shall be the amount provided by that appropriation.

(D) Emergency appropriations

(i) If, for any fiscal year, appropriations for discretionary accounts are enacted that the President designates as emergency requirements and that the Congress so designates in statute, the adjustment shall be the total of such appropriations in discretionary accounts designated as emergency requirements and the outlays flowing in all years from such appropriations.
This subparagraph shall not apply to appropriations to cover agricultural crop disaster assistance.

(ii) The costs for operation Desert Shield are to be treated as emergency funding requirements not subject to the defense spending limits.
Funding for Desert Shield will be provided through the normal legislative process.
Desert Shield costs should be accommodated through Allied burden-sharing, subsequent appropriation Acts, and if the President so chooses, through offsets within other defense accounts.
Emergency Desert Shield costs mean those incremental costs associated with the increase in operations in the Middle East and do not include costs that would be experienced by the Department of Defense as part of its normal operations absent Operation Desert Shield.

(E) Special allowance for discretionary new budget authority

(i) For each of fiscal years 1992 and 1993, the adjustment for the domestic category in each year shall be an amount equal to 0.1 percent of the sum of the adjusted discretionary spending limits on new budget authority for all categories for fiscal years 1991, 1992, and 1993 (cumulatively), together with outlays associated therewith (calculated at the composite outlay rate for the domestic category);

(ii) for each of fiscal years 1992 and 1993, the adjustment for the international category in each year shall be an amount equal to 0.079 percent of the sum of the adjusted discretionary spending limits on new budget authority for all categories for fiscal years 1991, 1992, and 1993 (cumulatively), together with outlays associated therewith (calculated at the composite outlay rate for the international category);

(iii) if, for fiscal years 1992 and 1993, the amount of new budget authority provided in appropriation Acts exceeds the discretionary spending limit on new budget authority for any category due to technical estimates made by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the adjustment is the amount of the excess, but not to exceed an amount (for 1992 and 1993 together) equal to 0.042 percent of the sum of the adjusted discretionary limits on new budget authority for all categories for fiscal years 1991, 1992, and 1993 (cumulatively); and

(iv) if, for fiscal years 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998, the amount of new budget authority provided in appropriation Acts exceeds the discretionary spending limit on new budget authority due to technical estimates made by the director 1 of the Office of Management and Budget, the adjustment is the amount of the excess, but not to exceed an amount (for any one fiscal year) equal to 0.1 percent of the adjusted descretionary 2 spending limit on new budget authority for that fiscal year.

(F) Special outlay allowance

If in any fiscal year outlays for a category exceed the discretionary spending limit for that category but new budget authority does not exceed its limit for that category (after application of the first step of a sequestration described in subsection (a)(2) of this section, if necessary), the adjustment in outlays is the amount of the excess, but not to exceed $2,500,000,000 in the defense category, $1,500,000,000 in the international category, or $2,500,000,000 in the domestic category (as applicable) in fiscal year 1991, 1992, or 1993, and not to exceed $6,500,000,000 in fiscal year 1994 or 1995 less any of the outlay adjustments made under subparagraph (E) for a category for a fiscal year, and not to exceed 0.5 percent of the adjusted descretionary 2 spending limit on outlays for the fiscal year in fiscal year 1996, 1997, or 1998.

(G) Net guarantee costs

The net costs for fiscal year 3 1994 and 1995 of the appropriation made under section 2186 of title 22 are not subject to the discretionary spending limits or the Appropriations Committee's Foreign Operations Subcommittee's [section] 602(b) [2 U.S.C. 665a(b)] allocation in fiscal year 3 1994 and 1995.

§901a. Sequestration with respect to Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund

(a) Sequestration

Within 15 days after Congress adjourns to end a session, there shall be a sequestration to eliminate any budgetary excess in the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund as described in subsection (b) of this section.

(b) Eliminating a budgetary excess

(1) In general

Except as provided by paragraph (2), appropriations from the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund shall be reduced by a uniform percentage necessary to eliminate any amount by which estimated outlays in the budget year from the Fund exceed the following levels of outlays:

(A) For fiscal year 1995, $703,000,000.

(B) For fiscal year 1996, $2,334,000,000.

(C) For fiscal year 1997, $3,936,000,000.

(D) For fiscal year 1998, $4,904,000,000.

For fiscal year 1999, the comparable level for budgetary purposes shall be deemed to be $5,639,000,000. For fiscal year 2000, the comparable level for budgetary purposes shall be deemed to be $6,225,000,000.

(2) Special outlay allowance

If estimated outlays from the Fund for a fiscal year exceed the level specified in paragraph (1) for that year, that level shall be increased by the lesser of that excess or 0.5 percent of that level.

(c) Look-back

If, after June 30, an appropriation for the fiscal year in progress is enacted that causes a budgetary excess in the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund as described in subsection (b) of this section for that year (after taking into account any sequestration of amounts under this section), the level set forth in subsection (b) of this section for the next fiscal year shall be reduced by the amount of that excess.

(d) Within-session sequestration

If an appropriation for a fiscal year in progress is enacted (after Congress adjourns to end the session for the budget year and before July 1 of that fiscal year) that causes a budgetary excess in the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund as described in subsection (b) of this section for that year (after taking into account any prior sequestration of amounts under this section), 15 days later there shall be a sequestration to eliminate that excess following the procedures set forth in subsection (b) of this section.

(e) Part-year appropriations and OMB estimates

Paragraphs (4) and (7) of section 901(a) of this title shall apply to appropriations from, and sequestration of amounts appropriated from, the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund under this section in the same manner as those paragraphs apply to discretionary appropriations and sequestrations under that section.

(Pub. L. 99–177, title II, §251A, as added Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXI, §310001(g)(1), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2104.)

§902. Enforcing pay-as-you-go

(a) Fiscal years 1992–1998 enforcement

The purpose of this section is to assure that any legislation (enacted after November 5, 1990) affecting direct spending or receipts that increases the deficit in any fiscal year covered by this Act will trigger an offsetting sequestration.

(b) Sequestration; look-back

Within 15 calendar days after Congress adjourns to end a session (other than of the One Hundred First Congress) and on the same day as a sequestration (if any) under section 901 of this title and section 903 of this title, there shall be a sequestration to offset the amount of any net deficit increase in that fiscal year and the prior fiscal year caused by all direct spending and receipts legislation enacted after November 5, 1990 (after adjusting for any prior sequestration as provided by paragraph (2)). OMB shall calculate the amount of deficit increase, if any, in those fiscal years by adding—

(1) all applicable estimates of direct spending and receipts legislation transmitted under subsection (d) of this section applicable to those fiscal years, other than any amounts included in such estimates resulting from—

(A) full funding of, and continuation of, the deposit insurance guarantee commitment in effect on November 5, 1990, and

(B) emergency provisions as designated under subsection (e) of this section; and

(2) the estimated amount of savings in direct spending programs applicable to those fiscal years resulting from the prior year's sequestration under this section or section 903 of this title, if any (except for any amounts sequestered as a result of a net deficit increase in the fiscal year immediately preceding the prior fiscal year), as published in OMB's end-of-session sequestration report for that prior year.

(c) Eliminating a deficit increase

(1) The amount required to be sequestered in a fiscal year under subsection (b) of this section shall be obtained from non-exempt direct spending accounts from actions taken in the following order:

(A) First

All reductions in automatic spending increases specified in section 906(a) of this title shall be made.

(B) Second

If additional reductions in direct spending accounts are required to be made, the maximum reductions permissible under sections 906(b) of this title (guaranteed student loans) and 906(c) of this title (foster care and adoption assistance) shall be made.

(C) Third

(i) If additional reductions in direct spending accounts are required to be made, each remaining non-exempt direct spending account shall be reduced by the uniform percentage necessary to make the reductions in direct spending required by paragraph (1); except that the medicare programs specified in section 906(d) of this title shall not be reduced by more than 4 percent and the uniform percentage applicable to all other direct spending programs under this paragraph shall be increased (if necessary) to a level sufficient to achieve the required reduction in direct spending.

(ii) For purposes of determining reductions under clause (i), outlay reductions (as a result of sequestration of Commodity Credit Corporation commodity price support contracts in the fiscal year of a sequestration) that would occur in the following fiscal year shall be credited as outlay reductions in the fiscal year of the sequestration.

(2) For purposes of this subsection, accounts shall be assumed to be at the level in the baseline.

(d) OMB estimates

As soon as practicable after Congress completes action on any direct spending or receipts legislation enacted after November 5, 1990, after consultation with the Committees on the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate, CBO shall provide OMB with an estimate of the amount of change in outlays or receipts, as the case may be, in each fiscal year through fiscal year 1998 resulting from that legislation.
Within 5 calendar days after the enactment of any direct spending or receipts legislation enacted after November 5, 1990, OMB shall transmit a report to the House of Representatives and to the Senate containing such CBO estimate of that legislation, an OMB estimate of the amount of change in outlays or receipts, as the case may be, in each fiscal year through fiscal year 1998 resulting from that legislation, and an explanation of any difference between the two estimates.
Those OMB estimates shall be made using current economic and technical assumptions. OMB and CBO shall prepare estimates under this paragraph in conformance with scorekeeping guidelines determined after consultation among the House and Senate Committees on the Budget, CBO, and OMB.

(e) Emergency legislation

If, for any fiscal year from 1991 through 1998, a provision of direct spending or receipts legislation is enacted that the President designates as an emergency requirement and that the Congress so designates in statute, the amounts of new budget authority, outlays, and receipts in all fiscal years through 1995 1 resulting from that provision shall be designated as an emergency requirement in the reports required under subsection (d) of this section.
This subsection shall not apply to direct spending provisions to cover agricultural crop disaster assistance.

§903. Enforcing deficit targets

(a) Sequestration

Within 15 calendar days after Congress adjourns to end a session (other than of the One Hundred First Congress) and on the same day as a sequestration (if any) under section 901 of this title and section 902 of this title, but after any sequestration required by section 901 of this title (enforcing discretionary spending limits) or section 902 of this title (enforcing pay-as-you-go), there shall be a sequestration to eliminate the excess deficit (if any remains) if it exceeds the margin.

(b) Excess deficit; margin

The excess deficit is, if greater than zero, the estimated deficit for the budget year, minus—

(1) the maximum deficit amount for that year;

(2) the amounts for that year designated as emergency direct spending or receipts legislation under section 902(e) of this title; and

(3) for any fiscal year in which there is not a full adjustment for technical and economic reestimates, the deposit insurance reestimate for that year, if any, calculated under subsection (h) of this section.

The “margin” for fiscal year 1992 or 1993 is zero and for fiscal year 1994 or 1995 is $15,000,000,000.

(c) Dividing sequestration

To eliminate the excess deficit in a budget year, half of the required outlay reductions shall be obtained from non-exempt defense accounts (accounts designated as function 050 in the President's fiscal year 1991 budget submission) and half from non-exempt, non-defense accounts (all other non-exempt accounts).

(d) Defense

Each non-exempt defense account shall be reduced by a dollar amount calculated by multiplying the level of sequestrable budgetary resources in that account at that time by the uniform percentage necessary to carry out subsection (c) of this section, except that, if any military personnel are exempt, adjustments shall be made under the procedure set forth in section 901(a)(3) of this title.

(e) Non-defense

Actions to reduce non-defense accounts shall be taken in the following order:

(1) First

All reductions in automatic spending increases under section 906(a) of this title shall be made.

(2) Second

If additional reductions in non-defense accounts are required to be made, the maximum reduction permissible under sections 906(b) of this title (guaranteed student loans) and 906(c) of this title (foster care and adoption assistance) shall be made.

(3) Third

(A) If additional reductions in non-defense accounts are required to be made, each remaining non-exempt, non-defense account shall be reduced by the uniform percentage necessary to make the reductions in non-defense outlays required by subsection (c) of this section, except that—

(i) the medicare program specified in section 906(d) of this title shall not be reduced by more than 2 percent in total including any reduction of less than 2 percent made under section 902 of this title or, if it has been reduced by 2 percent or more under section 902 of this title, it may not be further reduced under this section; and

(ii) the health programs set forth in section 906(e) of this title shall not be reduced by more than 2 percent in total (including any reduction made under section 901 of this title),

and the uniform percent applicable to all other programs under this subsection shall be increased (if necessary) to a level sufficient to achieve the required reduction in non-defense outlays.

(B) For purposes of determining reductions under subparagraph (A), outlay reduction (as a result of sequestration of Commodity Credit Corporation commodity price support contracts in the fiscal year of a sequestration) that would occur in the following fiscal year shall be credited as outlay reductions in the fiscal year of the sequestration.

(f) Baseline assumptions; part-year appropriations

(1) Budget assumptions

For purposes of subsections (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section, accounts shall be assumed to be at the level in the baseline minus any reductions required to be made under sections 901 and 902 of this title.

(2) Part-year appropriations

If, on the date specified in subsection (a) of this section, there is in effect an Act making or continuing appropriations for part of a fiscal year for any non-exempt budget account, then the dollar sequestration calculated for that account under subsection (d) or (e) of this section, as applicable, shall be subtracted from—

(A) the annualized amount otherwise available by law in that account under that or a subsequent part-year appropriation; and

(B) when a full-year appropriation for that account is enacted, from the amount otherwise provided by the full-year appropriation; except that the amount to be sequestered from that account shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the savings achieved by that appropriation when the enacted amount is less than the baseline for that account.

(g) Adjustments to maximum deficit amounts

(1) Adjustments

(A) When the President submits the budget for fiscal year 1992, the maximum deficit amounts for fiscal years 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995 shall be adjusted to reflect up-to-date reestimates of economic and technical assumptions and any changes in concepts or definitions.
When the President submits the budget for fiscal year 1993, the maximum deficit amounts for fiscal years 1993, 1994, and 1995 shall be further adjusted to reflect up-to-date reestimates of economic and technical assumptions and any changes in concepts or definitions.

(B) When submitting the budget for fiscal year 1994, the President may choose to adjust the maximum deficit amounts for fiscal years 1994 and 1995 to reflect up-to-date reestimates of economic and technical assumptions.
If the President chooses to adjust the maximum deficit amount when submitting the fiscal year 1994 budget, the President may choose to invoke the same adjustment procedure when submitting the budget for fiscal year 1995. In each case, the President must choose between making no adjustment or the full adjustment described in paragraph (2). If the President chooses to make that full adjustment, then those procedures for adjusting discretionary spending limits described in sections 901(b)(1)(C) and 901(b)(2)(E) of this title, otherwise applicable through fiscal year 1993 or 1994 (as the case may be), shall be deemed to apply for fiscal year 1994 (and 1995 if applicable).

(C) When the budget for fiscal year 1994 or 1995 is submitted and the sequestration reports for those years under section 904 of this title are made (as applicable), if the President does not choose to make the adjustments set forth in subparagraph (B), the maximum deficit amount for that fiscal year shall be adjusted by the amount of the adjustment to discretionary spending limits first applicable for that year (if any) under section 901(b) of this title.

(D) For each fiscal year the adjustments required to be made with the submission of the President's budget for that year shall also be made when OMB submits the sequestration update report and the final sequestration report for that year, but OMB shall continue to use the economic and technical assumptions in the President's budget for that year.

Each adjustment shall be made by increasing or decreasing the maximum deficit amounts set forth in section 665 of this title.

(2) Calculations of adjustments

The required increase or decrease shall be calculated as follows:

(A) The baseline deficit or surplus shall be calculated using up-to-date economic and technical assumptions, using up-to-date concepts and definitions, and, in lieu of the baseline levels of discretionary appropriations, using the discretionary spending limits set forth in section 665 of this title as adjusted under section 901 of this title.

(B) The net deficit increase or decrease caused by all direct spending and receipts legislation enacted after November 5, 1990 (after adjusting for any sequestration of direct spending accounts) shall be calculated for each fiscal year by adding—

(i) the estimates of direct spending and receipts legislation transmitted under section 902(d) of this title applicable to each such fiscal year; and

(ii) the estimated amount of savings in direct spending programs applicable to each such fiscal year resulting from the prior year's sequestration under this section or section 902 of this title of direct spending, if any, as contained in OMB's final sequestration report for that year.

(C) The amount calculated under subparagraph (B) shall be subtracted from the amount calculated under subparagraph (A).

(D) The maximum deficit amount set forth in section 665 of this title shall be subtracted from the amount calculated under subparagraph (C).

(E) The amount calculated under subparagraph (D) shall be the amount of the adjustment required by paragraph (1).

(h) Treatment of deposit insurance

(1) Initial estimates

The initial estimates of the net costs of federal deposit insurance for fiscal year 1994 and fiscal year 1995 (assuming full funding of, and continuation of, the deposit insurance guarantee commitment in effect on the date of the submission of the budget for fiscal year 1993) shall be set forth in that budget.

(2) Reestimates

For fiscal year 1994 and fiscal year 1995, the amount of the reestimate of deposit insurance costs shall be calculated by subtracting the amount set forth under paragraph (1) for that year from the current estimate of deposit insurance costs (but assuming full funding of, and continuation of, the deposit insurance guarantee commitment in effect on the date of submission of the budget for fiscal year 1993).

This title 3 shall not restrict the Commodity Credit Corporation in the discharge of its authority and responsibility as a corporation to buy and sell commodities in world trade, to use the proceeds as a revolving fund to meet other obligations and otherwise operate as a corporation, the purpose for which it was created.

Subject to subparagraph (B), after an order is issued under such section for a fiscal year, any cash payments made by the Commodity Credit Corporation—  

(i) under the terms of any one-year contract entered into in such fiscal year and after the issuance of the order; and  

(ii) out of an entitlement account,

  to any person (including any producer, lender, or guarantee entity) shall be subject to reduction under the order.  

(B) Each contract entered into with producers or producer cooperatives with respect to a particular crop of a commodity and subject to reduction under subparagraph (A) shall be reduced in accordance with the same terms and conditions.

All reductions described in paragraph (2) which are required to be made in connection with an order issued under section 904 of this title with respect to a fiscal year—  

(A) shall be made so as to ensure that outlays for each program, project, activity, or account involved are reduced by a percentage rate that is uniform for all such programs, projects, activities, and accounts, and may not be made so as to achieve a percentage rate of reduction in any such item exceeding the rate specified in the order; and  

(B) with respect to commodity price support and income protection programs, shall be made in such manner and under such procedures as will attempt to ensure that—  

(i) uncertainty as to the scope of benefits under any such program is minimized;  

(ii) any instability in market prices for agricultural commodities resulting from the reduction is minimized; and  

(iii) normal production and marketing relationships among agricultural commodities (including both contract and non-contract commodities) are not distorted.

  In meeting the criterion set out in clause (iii) of subparagraph (B) of the preceding sentence, the President shall take into consideration that reductions under an order may apply to programs for two or more agricultural commodities that use the same type of production or marketing resources or that are alternative commodities among which a producer could choose in making annual production decisions.  

(5) No double reduction  

No agricultural price support or income protection program that is subject to reduction under an order issued under section 904 of this title for a fiscal year may be subject, as well, to modification or suspension under such order as an automatic spending increase.

Such an order may not reduce any Federal matching rate pursuant to section 403(l) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 603(l)].  

(2) New allotment formula  

(A) General rule  

Notwithstanding section 403(k) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 603(k)], each State's percentage share of the amount available after sequestration for direct spending pursuant to section 403(l) of such Act for the fiscal year to which the sequestration applies shall be equal to—  

(i) 5 the lesser of—  

(I) that percentage of the total amount paid to the States pursuant to such section 403(l) for the prior fiscal year that is represented by the amount paid to such State pursuant to such section 403(l) for the prior fiscal year; or  

(II) the amount that would have been allotted to such State pursuant to such section 403(k) had the sequestration not been in effect.  

(B) Reallotment of amounts remaining unallotted after application of general rule  

Any amount made available after sequestration for direct spending pursuant to section 403(l) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 603(l)] for the fiscal year to which the sequestration applies that remains unallotted as a result of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall be allotted among the States in proportion to the absolute difference between the amount allotted, respectively, to each State as a result of such subparagraph and the amount that would have been allotted to such State pursuant to section 403(k) of such Act had the sequestration not been in effect, except that a State may not be allotted an amount under this subparagraph that results in a total allotment to the State under this paragraph of more than the amount that would have been allotted to such State pursuant to such section 403(k) had the sequestration not been in effect.  

(l) Effects of sequestration  

The effects of sequestration shall be as follows:  

(1) Budgetary resources sequestered from any account other than a trust or special fund account shall be permanently cancelled.  

(2) Except as otherwise provided, the same percentage sequestration shall apply to all programs, projects, and activities within a budget account (with programs, projects, and activities as delineated in the appropriation Act or accompanying report for the relevant fiscal year covering that account, or for accounts not included in appropriation Acts, as delineated in the most recently submitted President's budget).  

(3) Administrative regulations or similar actions implementing a sequestration shall be made within 120 days of the sequestration order.
To the extent that formula allocations differ at different levels of budgetary resources within an account, program, project, or activity, the sequestration shall be interpreted as producing a lower total appropriation, with the remaining amount of the appropriation being obligated in a manner consistent with program allocation formulas in substantive law.  

(4) Except as otherwise provided, obligations in sequestered accounts shall be reduced only in the fiscal year in which a sequester occurs.  

(5) If an automatic spending increase is sequestered, the increase (in the applicable index) that was disregarded as a result of that sequestration shall not be taken into account in any subsequent fiscal year.  

(6) Except as otherwise provided, sequestration in trust and special fund accounts for which obligations are indefinite shall be taken in a manner to ensure that obligations in the fiscal year of a sequestration are reduced, from the level that would actually have occurred, by the applicable sequestration percentage.

§907. The baseline

(a) In general

For any budget year, the baseline refers to a projection of current-year levels of new budget authority, outlays, revenues, and the surplus or deficit into the budget year and the outyears based on laws enacted through the applicable date.

(b) Direct spending and receipts

For the budget year and each outyear, the baseline shall be calculated using the following assumptions:

(1) In general

Laws providing or creating direct spending and receipts are assumed to operate in the manner specified in those laws for each such year and funding for entitlement authority is assumed to be adequate to make all payments required by those laws.

(2) Exceptions

(A) No program with estimated current-year outlays greater than $50 million shall be assumed to expire in the budget year or outyears.

(B) The increase for veterans’ compensation for a fiscal year is assumed to be the same as that required by law for veterans’ pensions unless otherwise provided by law enacted in that session.

(C) Excise taxes dedicated to a trust fund, if expiring, are assumed to be extended at current rates.

(3) Hospital Insurance Trust Fund

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the receipts and disbursements of the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund shall be included in all calculations required by this Act.

(c) Discretionary appropriations

For the budget year and each outyear, the baseline shall be calculated using the following assumptions regarding all amounts other than those covered by subsection (b) of this section:

(1) Inflation of current-year appropriations

Budgetary resources other than unobligated balances shall be at the level provided for the budget year in full-year appropriation Acts.
If for any account a full-year appropriation has not yet been enacted, budgetary resources other than unobligated balances shall be at the level available in the current year, adjusted sequentially and cumulatively for expiring housing contracts as specified in paragraph (2), for social insurance administrative expenses as specified in paragraph (3), to offset pay absorption and for pay annualization as specified in paragraph (4), for inflation as specified in paragraph (5), and to account for changes required by law in the level of agency payments for personnel benefits other than pay.

(2) Expiring housing contracts

New budget authority to renew expiring multiyear subsidized housing contracts shall be adjusted to reflect the difference in the number of such contracts that are scheduled to expire in that fiscal year and the number expiring in the current year, with the per-contract renewal cost equal to the average current-year cost of renewal contracts.

(3) Social insurance administrative expenses

Budgetary resources for the administrative expenses of the following trust funds shall be adjusted by the percentage change in the beneficiary population from the current year to that fiscal year: the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, the Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund, the Unemployment Trust Fund, and the railroad retirement account.

(4) Pay annualization; offset to pay absorption

Current-year new budget authority for Federal employees shall be adjusted to reflect the full 12-month costs (without absorption) of any pay adjustment that occurred in that fiscal year.

(5) Inflators

The inflator used in paragraph (1) to adjust budgetary resources relating to personnel shall be the percent by which the average of the Bureau of Labor Statistics Employment Cost Index (wages and salaries, private industry workers) for that fiscal year differs from such index for the current year.
The inflator used in paragraph (1) to adjust all other budgetary resources shall be the percent by which the average of the estimated gross national product fixed-weight price index for that fiscal year differs from the average of such estimated index for the current year.

(6) Current-year appropriations

If, for any account, a continuing appropriation is in effect for less than the entire current year, then the current-year amount shall be assumed to equal the amount that would be available if that continuing appropriation covered the entire fiscal year.
If law permits the transfer of budget authority among budget accounts in the current year, the current-year level for an account shall reflect transfers accomplished by the submission of, or assumed for the current year in, the President's original budget for the budget year.

(d) Up-to-date concepts

To the extent that any part is not affirmed, the resolution shall state which parts are not affirmed and shall contain instructions to committees of the Senate of the type referred to in section 641(a) of this title, sufficient to achieve at least the total level of deficit reduction contained in those sections which are not affirmed.

(3) Response of committees

Committees instructed pursuant to paragraph (2), or affected thereby, shall submit their responses to the Budget Committee no later than 10 days after the resolution referred to in paragraph (2) is agreed to, except that if only one such Committee is so instructed such Committee shall, by the same date, report to the Senate a reconciliation bill or reconciliation resolution containing its recommendations in response to such instructions.
A committee shall be considered to have complied with all instructions to it pursuant to a resolution adopted under paragraph (2) if it has made recommendations with respect to matters within its jurisdiction which would result in a reduction in the deficit at least equal to the total reduction directed by such instructions.

(4) Budget Committee action

Upon receipt of the recommendations received in response to a resolution referred to in paragraph (2), the Budget Committee shall report to the Senate a reconciliation bill or reconciliation resolution, or both, carrying out all such recommendations without any substantive revisions.
In the event that a committee instructed in a resolution referred to in paragraph (2) fails to submit any recommendation (or, when only one committee is instructed, fails to report a reconciliation bill or resolution) in response to such instructions, the Budget Committee shall include in the reconciliation bill or reconciliation resolution reported pursuant to this subparagraph legislative language within the jurisdiction of the noncomplying committee to achieve the amount of deficit reduction directed in such instructions.

(5) Point of order

It shall not be in order in the Senate to consider any reconciliation bill or reconciliation resolution reported under paragraph (4) with respect to a fiscal year, any amendment thereto, or any conference report thereon if—

(A) the enactment of such bill or resolution as reported;

(B) the adoption and enactment of such amendment; or

(C) the enactment of such bill or resolution in the form recommended in such conference report,

would cause the amount of the deficit for such fiscal year to exceed the maximum deficit amount for such fiscal year, unless the low-growth report submitted under section 904 of this title projects negative real economic growth for such fiscal year, or for each of any two consecutive quarters during such fiscal year.

(6) Treatment of certain amendments

In the Senate, an amendment which adds to a resolution reported under paragraph (2) an instruction of the type referred to in such paragraph shall be in order during the consideration of such resolution if such amendment would be in order but for the fact that it would be held to be non-germane on the basis that the instruction constitutes new matter.

(7) “Day” defined

For purposes of paragraphs (1), (2), and (3), the term “day” shall mean any calendar day on which the Senate is in session.
