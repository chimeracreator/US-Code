Section 1. As used in this order, (a) the term “materials” includes articles and supplies, (b) the term “executive agency” includes executive department, independent establishment, and other instrumentality of the executive branch of the Government, and (c) the term “bid or offered price of materials of foreign origin” means the bid or offered price of such materials delivered at the place specified in the invitation to bid including applicable duty and all costs incurred after arrival in the United States.

Sec. 2. (a) For the purposes of this order materials shall be considered to be of foreign origin if the cost of the foreign products used in such materials constitutes fifty per centum or more of the cost of all the products used in such materials.

(b) For the purposes of the said act of March 3, 1933 [see Tables for classification], and the other laws referred to in the first paragraph of the preamble of this order, the bid or offered price of materials of domestic origin shall be deemed to be unreasonable, or the purchase of such materials shall be deemed to be inconsistent with the public interest, if the bid or offered price thereof exceeds the sum of the bid or offered price of like materials of foreign origin and a differential computed as provided in subsection (c) of this section.

(c) The executive agency concerned shall in each instance determine the amount of the differential referred to in subsection (b) of this section on the basis of one of the following-described formulas, subject to the terms thereof:

(1) The sum determined by computing six per centum of the bid or offered price of materials of foreign origin.

(2) The sum determined by computing ten per centum of the bid or offered price of materials of foreign origin exclusive of applicable duty and all costs incurred after arrival in the United States: provided that when the bid or offered price of materials of foreign origin amounts to less than $25,000, the sum shall be determined by computing ten per centum of such price exclusive only of applicable duty.

(a) To reject any bid or offer for reasons of the national interest not described or referred to in this order; or

(b) To place a fair proportion of the total purchases with small business concerns in accordance with section 302(b) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended [41 U.S.C. 252(b)], section 2(b) of the Armed Services Procurement Act of 1947, as amended [41 U.S.C. 151(b)], and section 202 of the Small Business Act of 1953 [15 U.S.C. 631]; or

(c) To reject a bid or offer to furnish material of foreign origin in any situation in which the domestic supplier offering the lowest price for furnishing the desired materials undertakes to produce substantially all of such materials in areas of substantial unemployment, as determined by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with such appropriate regulations as he may establish and during such period as the President may determine that it is in the national interest to provide to such areas preference in the award of Government contracts: Provided, that nothing in this section shall prevent the rejection of a bid or offered price which is excessive; or

(d) To reject any bid or offer for materials of foreign origin if such rejection is necessary to protect essential national-security interests after receiving advice with respect thereto from the President or from the Director [now Administrator] of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
In providing this advice the Director [Administrator] shall be governed by the principle that exceptions under this section shall be made only upon a clear showing that the payment of a greater differential than the procedures of this section generally prescribe is justified by consideration of national security.

Sec. 4. The head of each executive agency shall issue such regulations as may be necessary to insure that procurement practices under his jurisdiction conform to the provisions of this order.

Sec. 5. This order shall apply only to contracts entered into after the date hereof.
In any case in which the head of an executive agency proposing to purchase domestic materials determines that a greater differential than that provided in this order between the cost of such materials of domestic origin and materials of foreign origin is not unreasonable or that the purchase of materials of domestic origin is not inconsistent with the public interest, this order shall not apply.

The Department of Labor may conduct hearings to assist in the identification of those products.

Sec. 3. Procurement Regulations.
Within 120 days after the date of this order, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council shall issue proposed rules to implement the following:

(a) Required Solicitation Provisions.
Each solicitation of offers for a contract for the procurement of a product included on the list published under section 2 of this order shall include the following provisions:

(2) A provision that obligates the contractor to cooperate fully in providing reasonable access to the contractor's records, documents, persons, or premises if reasonably requested by authorized officials of the contracting agency, the Department of the Treasury, or the Department of Justice, for the purpose of determining whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any product furnished under the contract.

(b) Investigations.
Whenever a contracting officer of an executive agency has reason to believe that forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture a product furnished pursuant to a contract subject to the requirements of subsection 3(a) of this order, the head of the executive agency shall refer the matter for investigation to the Inspector General of the executive agency and, as the head of the executive agency or the Inspector General determines appropriate, to the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury.

(3) The head of an executive agency may debar or suspend a contractor from eligibility for Federal contracts on the basis of a finding that the contractor has engaged in an act described in subsection 3(c)(1) of this order.
The provision for debarment may not exceed 3 years.

(4) The Administrator of General Services shall include on the List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs (maintained by the Administrator as described in the Federal Acquisition Regulation) each party that is debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment or suspension, or declared ineligible by the head of an agency on the basis that the person has engaged in an act described in subsection 3(c)(1) of this order.

(5) This section shall not be construed to limit the use of other remedies available to the head of an executive agency or any other official of the Federal Government on the basis of a finding described in subsection 3(c)(1) of this order.

Sec. 4. Report.
Within 2 years after implementation of any final rule under this order, the Administrator of General Services, with the assistance of other executive agencies, shall submit to the Office of Management and Budget a report on the actions taken pursuant to this order.

(2) the contract is of a value that is equal to or greater than the United States threshold specified in the Agreement on Government Procurement annexed to the WTO Agreement or NAFTA, whichever is applicable.

Sec. 7. Judicial Review.
This order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and does not create any rights or benefits, substantive or procedural, enforceable by law by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any other person.

§39. Hearings on Walsh-Healey provisions by Secretary of Labor; witness fees; failure to obey order; punishment

Upon his own motion or on application of any person affected by any ruling of any agency of the United States in relation to any proposal or contract involving any of the provisions of sections 35 to 45 of this title, and on complaint of a breach or violation of any representation or stipulation as provided in said sections, the Secretary of Labor, or an impartial representative designated by him, shall have the power to hold hearings and to issue orders requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence under oath.
Witnesses shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the courts of the United States.
In case of contumacy, failure, or refusal of any person to obey such an order, any District Court of the United States or of any Territory or possession within the jurisdiction of which the inquiry is carried on, or within the jurisdiction of which said person who is guilty of contumacy, failure, or refusal is found, or resides or transacts business, upon the application by the Secretary of Labor or representative designated by him, shall have jurisdiction to issue to such person an order requiring such person to appear before him or representative designated by him, to produce evidence if, as, and when so ordered, and to give testimony relating to the matter under investigation or in question; and any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by said court as a contempt thereof; and shall make findings of fact after notice and hearing, which findings shall be conclusive upon all agencies of the United States, and if supported by the preponderance of the evidence, shall be conclusive in any court of the United States; and the Secretary of Labor or authorized representative shall have the power, and is authorized, to make such decisions, based upon findings of fact, as are deemed to be necessary to enforce the provisions of sections 35 to 45 of this title.

(June 30, 1936, ch. 881, §5, 49 Stat. 2038; June 25, 1948, ch. 646, §32(b), 62 Stat. 991; May 24, 1949, ch. 139, §127, 63 Stat. 107.)

Codification

As originally enacted, the words “, or the district court of the United States for the District of Columbia,” were set out following “Territory or possession”. Act June 25, 1948, as amended by act May 24, 1949, substituted “United States District Court for the District of Columbia” for “district court of the United States for the District of Columbia”. The words “United States District Court for the District of Columbia” have been deleted entirely as superfluous in view of section 132(a) of Title 28, Judiciary and Judicial Procedure, which states that “There shall be in each judicial district a district court which shall be a court of record known as the United States District Court for the district”, and section 88 of title 28 which states that “the District of Columbia constitutes one judicial district”.

§40. Exceptions from Walsh-Healey provisions; modification of contracts; variations; overtime; suspension of representations and stipulations

Upon a written finding by the head of the contracting agency or department that the inclusion in the proposal or contract of the representations or stipulations set forth in section 35 of this title will seriously impair the conduct of Government business, the Secretary of Labor shall make exceptions in specific cases or otherwise when justice or public interest will be served thereby.
Upon the joint recommendation of the contracting agency and the contractor, the Secretary of Labor may modify the terms of an existing contract respecting minimum rates of pay and maximum hours of labor as he may find necessary and proper in the public interest or to prevent injustice and undue hardship.
The Secretary of Labor may provide reasonable limitations and may make rules and regulations allowing reasonable variations, tolerances, and exemptions to and from any or all provisions of sections 35 to 45 of this title respecting minimum rates of pay and maximum hours of labor or the extent of the application of said sections to contractors, as hereinbefore described.
Whenever the Secretary of Labor shall permit an increase in the maximum hours of labor stipulated in the contract, he shall set a rate of pay for any overtime, which rate shall be not less than one and one-half times the basic hourly rate received by any employee affected: Provided, That whenever in his judgment such course is in the public interest, the President is authorized to suspend any or all of the representations and stipulations contained in section 35 of this title.

(June 30, 1936, ch. 881, §6, 49 Stat. 2038; June 28, 1940, ch. 440, title I, §13, 54 Stat. 681.)

§41. “Person” defined in Walsh-Healey provisions

Whenever used in sections 35 to 45 of this title, the word “person” includes one or more individuals, partnerships, associations, corporations, legal representatives, trustees, trustees in cases under title 11, or receivers.

(June 30, 1936, ch. 881, §7, 49 Stat. 2039; Pub. L. 95–598, title III, §326, Nov. 6, 1978, 92 Stat. 2679.)

§42. Effect of Walsh-Healey provisions on other laws

The provisions of sections 35 to 45 of this title shall not be construed to modify or amend Title III of the act entitled “An Act making appropriations for the Treasury and Post Office Departments for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1934, and for other purposes”, approved May 3, 1933 (commonly known as the Buy American Act) [41 U.S.C. 10a et seq.], nor shall the provisions of sections 35 to 45 of this title be construed to modify or amend sections 3141–3144, 3146, and 3147 of title 40, nor the labor provisions of Title II of the National Industrial Recovery Act, approved June 16, 1933, as extended, or of section 7 of the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act, approved April 8, 1935; nor shall the provisions of sections 35 to 45 of this title be construed to modify or amend chapter 307 and section 4162 1 of title 18.

§101. Declaration of policy

The Congress declares that the objectives of this chapter are—

(a) to facilitate maximum war production during the war, and to expedite reconversion from war production to civilian production as war conditions permit;

(b) to assure to prime contractors and subcontractors, small and large, speedy and equitable final settlement of claims under terminated war contracts, and adequate interim financing until such final settlement;

(c) to assure uniformity among Government agencies in basic policies and administration with respect to such termination settlements and interim financing;

(d) to facilitate the efficient use of materials, manpower, and facilities for war and civilian purposes by providing prime contractors and subcontractors with notice of termination of their war contracts as far in advance of the cessation of work thereunder as is feasible and consistent with the national security;

(e) to assure the expeditious removal from the plants of prime contractors and subcontractors of termination inventory not to be retained or sold by the contractor;

(f) to use all practicable methods compatible with the foregoing objectives to prevent improper payments and to detect and prosecute fraud.

Codification

In subsec. (d) of this section, “chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53” substituted for “the Classification Act of 1949” on authority of Pub. L. 89–554, §7(b), Sept. 6, 1966, 80 Stat. 631, the first section of which enacted Title 5, Government Organization and Employees.

In the second sentence of this section, provisions that authorized the appointment of a Deputy Director and that authorized the employment of certified public accountants, qualified cost accountants, industrial engineers, appraisers, and other experts without regard to “the Classification Act of 1923”, were omitted as obsolete.
Sections 1202 and 1204 of the Classification Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 972, 973, repealed the 1923 Act and all laws or parts of laws inconsistent with the 1949 Act.
While section 1106(a) of the 1949 Act provided that references in other laws to the 1923 Act should be held and considered to mean the 1949 Act, it did not have the effect of continuing the exceptions contained in this sentence because of section 1106(b) which provided that the application of the 1949 Act to any position, officer, or employee shall not be affected by section 1106(a). The Classification Act of 1949 was repealed by Pub. L. 89–554, Sept. 6, 1966, §8(a), 80 Stat. 632 (of which section 1 revised and enacted Title 5 into law). Section 5102 of Title 5 contains the applicability provisions of the 1949 Act, and section 5103 of Title 5 authorizes the Office of Personnel Management to determine the applicability to specific positions and employees.

See sections 3(2) and 14 of Pub. L. 92–463, Oct. 6, 1972, 86 Stat. 770, 776, set out in the Appendix to Title 5, Government Organization and Employees.

§106. Basis for settlement of termination claims

(a) Priority to private contractors

It is the policy of the Government, and it shall be the responsibility of the contracting agencies and the Administrator of General Services to provide war contractors with speedy and fair compensation for the termination of any war contract, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this chapter, giving priority to contractors whose facilities are privately owned or privately operated.
Such fair compensation for the termination of subcontracts shall be based on the same principles as compensation for the termination of prime contracts.

(b) Establishment of methods and standards

Each contracting agency shall establish methods and standards, suitable to the conditions of various war contractors, for determining fair compensation for the termination of war contracts on the basis of actual, standard, average, or estimated costs, or of a percentage of the contract price based on the estimated percentage of completion of work under the terminated contract, or on any other equitable basis, as it deems appropriate.
To the extent that such methods and standards require accounting, they shall be adapted, so far as practicable, to the accounting systems used by war contractors, if consistent with recognized commercial accounting practice.

(c) Conclusiveness of settlement

Any contracting agency may settle all or any part of any termination claim under any war contract by agreement with the war contractor, or by determination of the amount due on the claim or part thereof without such agreement, or by any combination of these methods.
Where any such settlement is made by agreement, the settlement shall be final and conclusive, except (1) to the extent otherwise agreed in the settlement; (2) for fraud; (3) upon renegotiation to eliminate excessive profits under section 1191 of Appendix to title 50, unless exempt or exempted under such section; or (4) by mutual agreement before or after payment.
Where any such settlement is made by determination without agreement, it shall likewise be final and conclusive, subject to the same exceptions as if made by agreement, unless the war contractor appeals or brings suit in accordance with section 113 of this title: Provided, That no settlement agreement hereunder involving payment to a war contractor of an amount in excess of $50,000 (or such lesser amount as the Administrator of General Services may from time to time determine) shall become binding upon the Government until the agreement has been reviewed and approved by a settlement review board of three or more members established by the contracting agency in the bureau, division, regional or district office, or other unit of the contracting agency authorized to make such settlement, or in the event of disapproval by the settlement review board, unless approved by the head of such bureau, division, regional or district office, or other unit.
Failure of the settlement review board to act upon any settlement within thirty days after its submission to the board shall operate as approval by the board.
The sole function of settlement review boards shall be to determine the over-all reasonableness of proposed settlement agreements from the point of view of protecting the interests of the Government.
In determining, for purposes of this subsection, whether review of any settlement agreement is required because of the amounts involved, no deduction shall be made on account of credits for property chargeable to the Government or for advance or partial payments, but amounts payable under such settlement agreement for completed articles or work at the contract price and for the discharge of the termination claims of subcontractors shall be deducted.

(d) Allowable costs

Except as hereinafter provided, the methods and standards established under subsection (b) of this section for determining fair compensation for termination claims which are not settled by agreement shall be designed to compensate the war contractor fairly for the termination of the war contract, taking into account—

(1) the direct and indirect manufacturing, selling and distribution, administrative and other costs and expenses incurred by the war contractor which are reasonably necessary for the performance of the war contract and properly allocable to the terminated portion thereof under recognized commercial accounting practices; and

(2) reasonable costs and expenses of settling termination claims of subcontractors related to the terminated portion of the war contract; and

(3) reasonable accounting, legal, clerical, and other costs and expenses incident to termination and settlement of the terminated war contract; and

(4) reasonable costs and expenses of removing, preserving, storing and disposing of termination inventories; and

(5) such allowance for profit on the preparations made and work done for the terminated portion of the war contract as is reasonable under the circumstances; and

(6) interest on the termination claim in accordance with subsection (f) of this section; and

(7) the contract price and all amounts otherwise paid or payable under the contract.

The following shall not be included as elements of cost:

(i) Losses on other contracts, or from sales or exchanges of capital assets, fees and other expenses in connection with reorganization or recapitalization, antitrust or Federal income-tax litigation, or prosecution of Federal income-tax claims or other claims against the Government (except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection); losses on investments; provisions for contingencies; and premiums on life insurance where the contractor is the beneficiary.

(ii) The expense of conversion of the contractor's facilities to uses other than the performance of the contract.

(iii) Expenses due to the negligence or willful failure of the contractor to discontinue with reasonable promptness the incurring of expenses after the effective date of the termination notice.

(iv) Costs incurred in respect to facilities, materials, or services purchased or work done in excess of the reasonable quantitative requirements of the entire contract.

The failure specifically to mention in this subsection any item of cost is not intended to imply that it should be allowed or disallowed.
The Administrator of General Services may interpret the provisions of this subsection and may provide for the inclusion or exclusion of other costs in accordance with recognized commercial accounting practice.

Where the small size of claims or the nature of production or performance or other factors make it impracticable to apply the principles stated in this subsection to any class of settlements which are subject to this subsection, the contracting agencies may establish alternative methods and standards for determining fair compensation for that class of termination claims.
The aggregate amount of compensation allowed in accordance with this subsection (excluding amounts allowed under paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection) shall not exceed the total contract price reduced by the amount of payments otherwise made or to be made under the contract.

(e) Settlement by agreement

In order to carry out the objectives of this chapter, termination claims shall be settled by agreement to the maximum extent feasible and the methods and standards established under subsection (b) of this section shall be designed to facilitate such settlements.
To the extent that he deems it practicable to do so without impeding expeditious settlements, the Administrator of General Services shall require the contracting agencies to take into account the factors enumerated in subsection (d) of this section in establishing methods and standards for determining fair compensation in the settlement of termination claims by agreement.

(f) Interest

Each contracting agency shall allow and pay interest on the amount due and unpaid from time to time on any termination claim under a prime contract at the rate of 21/2 per centum per annum for the period beginning thirty days after the date fixed for termination and ending with the date of final payment, except that (1) if the prime contractor unreasonably delays the settlement of his claim, interest shall not accrue for the period of such delay, (2) if interest for the period after termination on any advance payment or loan, made or guaranteed by the Government, has been waived for the benefit of the contractor, the amount of the interest so waived allocable to the terminated contract or the terminated part of the contract shall be deducted from the interest otherwise payable hereunder, and (3) if after delivery of findings by a contracting agency, the contractor appeals or sues as provided in section 113 of this title, interest shall not accrue after the thirtieth day following the delivery of the findings on any amount allowed by such findings, unless such amount is increased upon such appeal or suit.
In approving, ratifying, authorizing, or making termination settlements with subcontractors, each contracting agency shall allow interest on the termination claim of the subcontractor on the same basis and subject to the same conditions as are applicable to a prime contractor.

(g) Amendment of contracts

Where any war contract does not provide for or provides against such fair compensation for its termination, the contracting agency, either before or after its termination, shall amend such war contract by agreement with the war contractor, or shall authorize, approve, or ratify an amendment of such war contract by the parties thereto, to provide for such fair compensation.

Settlement of Claims for War Contract Losses Incurred Between September 16, 1940, and August 14, 1945

Act Aug. 7, 1946, ch. 864, 60 Stat. 902, as amended by June 25, 1948, ch. 646, §37, 62 Stat. 992; Aug. 30, 1954, ch. 1076, §1(2), 68 Stat. 966, provided that if work, supplies, or services were provided for any department or agency of the Government, under a contract or subcontract, between Sept. 16, 1940, and Aug. 14, 1945, and a loss was incurred by the contractors or subcontractors without fault or negligence on their part, then those departments or agencies were authorized to adjust and settle these losses on a fair and equitable basis, if claims were filed within six months after Aug. 7, 1946, and granted claimants dissatisfied with the settlement the right of judicial review.

§107. Settlement of subcontractors’ claims

(a) Conclusiveness of settlement

Where, in connection with the settlement of any termination claim by a contracting agency, any war contractor makes settlements of the termination claims of his subcontractors, the contracting agency shall limit or omit its review of such settlements with subcontractors to the maximum extent compatible with the public interest.
Any contracting agency (1) may approve, ratify, or authorize such settlements with subcontractors upon such evidence, terms, and conditions as it deems proper; (2) shall vary the scope and intensity of its review of such settlements according to the reliability of the war contractor, the size, number, and complexity of such claims, and other relevant factors; and (3) shall authorize war contractors to make such settlements with subcontractors without review by the contracting agency, whenever the reliability of the war contractor, the amount or nature of the claims, or other reasons appear to the contracting agency to justify such action.
Any such settlement of a subcontract approved, ratified, or authorized by a contracting agency shall be final and conclusive as to the amount due to the same extent as a settlement under subsection (c) of section 106 of this title, and no war contractor shall be liable to the United States on account of any amounts paid thereon except for his own fraud.

(b) Supervision of payments to war contractors

Whenever any contracting agency is satisfied of the inability of a war contractor to meet his obligations it shall exercise supervision or control over payments to the war contractor on account of termination claims of subcontractors of such war contractor to such extent and in such manner as it deems necessary or desirable for the purpose of assuring the receipt of the benefit of such payments by the subcontractors.

(c) Group settlements

The Administrator of General Services shall prescribe policies and methods for the settlement as a group, or otherwise, by any contracting agency of some or all of the termination claims of a war contractor under war contracts with one or more (1) bureaus or divisions within a contracting agency, (2) contracting agencies, or (3) prime contractors and subcontractors, to the extent he deems such action necessary or desirable for expeditious and equitable settlement of such claims.
After consulting with the contracting agencies concerned, the Administrator of General Services may provide for assigning any war contractor to a contracting agency for such settlement, and such agency shall have authority to settle, on behalf of any other contracting agency, some or all of the termination claims of such war contractor.

(d) Direct settlement by contracting agency

Any contracting agency may settle directly termination claims of subcontractors to the extent that it deems such action necessary or desirable for the expeditious and equitable settlement of such claims.
In making such termination settlements any contracting agency may discharge the claim of the subcontractor by payment or may purchase such claim, and may agree to assume, or indemnify the subcontractor against, any claims by any person in connection with such claim or the termination settlement.
Any contracting agency undertaking to settle the termination claim of any subcontractor shall deliver to the subcontractor and the war contractor liable to him written notice stating its acceptance of responsibility for settling his claim and the conditions applicable thereto, which may include the release, or assignment to the contracting agency, of his claim against the war contractor liable to him; upon consent thereto by the subcontractor, the Government shall become liable for the settlement of his claims upon the conditions specified in the notice.

(e) Amount of settlement

Any contracting agency may make settlements with subcontractors in accordance with any of the provisions of this chapter without regard to any limitation on the amount payable by the Government to the prime contractor.

(f) Equitable payments

If any contracting agency determines that in the circumstances of a particular case equity and good conscience require fair compensation for the termination of a war contract to be paid to a subcontractor who has been deprived of and cannot otherwise reasonably secure such fair compensation, the contracting agency concerned may pay such compensation to him although such compensation already has been included and paid as part of a settlement with another war contractor.

§108. Interim financing

(a) Prime contractors

It is the policy of the Government, and it shall be the responsibility of the contracting agencies and the Administrator of General Services, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this chapter, to provide war contractors having any termination claim or claims, pending their settlement, with adequate interim financing, within thirty days after proper application therefor.

(b) Method of financing; amounts payable

Each contracting agency shall, to the greatest extent it deems practicable, make available interim financing through loans and discounts, and commitments and guaranties in connection therewith, in contemplation of or related to termination of war contracts.
Where interim financing is made by advance payments or partial payments, it shall, insofar as practicable, consist of the following:

(1) An amount equal to 100 per centum of the amount payable, at the contract price, on account of acceptable items completed prior to the termination date under the terms of the contract, or completed thereafter with the approval of the contracting agency; plus

(2) An amount equal to 90 per centum of the cost of raw materials, purchased parts, supplies, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead allocable to the terminated portion of the war contract; plus

(3) A reasonable percentage of other allowable costs, including administrative overhead, allocable to the terminated portion of the war contract not included in the foregoing; plus

(4) Such additional amounts, if any, as the contracting agency deems necessary to provide the war contractor with adequate interim financing.

(5) In lieu of the costs referred to in clauses (2) and (3) of this subsection, where a detailed ascertainment of such costs is not suitable to the conditions of any war contractor and is apt to cause delay in the obtaining of interim financing by him, that portion of such interim financing shall be equal to an amount not greater than 90 per centum of the estimated costs which are allocable to the terminated part or parts of the war contract or group of war contracts, and are ascertained in accordance with such methods and standards as the Administrator of General Services shall prescribe.

(6) There shall be deducted from the amount of such interim financing any unliquidated balances of advance and partial payments theretofore made to such war contractor, which are allocable to the terminated war contract or the terminated part of the war contract.

(c) Evidence to support financing

The Administrator of General Services shall prescribe (1) the types of estimates, certificates, or other evidence to be required to support such interim financing; (2) the terms and conditions upon which such interim financing shall be made including the use of standard forms for agreements with respect to such interim financing to the extent practicable; (3) the classes of cases in which such interim financing shall be refused; and (4) such methods of supervision and control over such interim financing as he deems necessary or desirable to assure adequate and speedy interim financing to subcontractors of the war contractor.

(d) Penalty for overstatement of claims

In case of an overstatement by any war contractor of the amount due on his termination claim or claims in connection with any interim financing under this chapter, such contractor shall pay to the United States, as a penalty, an amount equal to 6 per centum of the amount of the overstatement, but the Administrator of General Services may suspend or modify any such penalty if in his opinion the imposition thereof would be inequitable.
Any penalty may be deducted from any amounts due the war contractor upon such termination claim or claims, or otherwise, or may be collected from the war contractor by suit.
The obligation to pay any penalty imposed and to repay any interim financing made or assumed by the United States under this chapter shall constitute a debt due to the United States within the meaning of section 3713(a) of title 31.

(e) Advance payments as part of termination settlement

Any contracting agency may allow any advance payments, previously made or authorized by it in connection with the performance of a war contract, to be used for payments and expenses related to the termination settlement of such contract, upon such terms and conditions as it deems necessary or appropriate to protect the interest of the Government.

(f) Liquidation of loans, etc., prior to final settlement

No interim financing shall be made by any contracting agency under this chapter unless the terms of such financing provide for the liquidation by the war contractor of all loans, discounts, advance payments, or partial payments thereunder not later than the time of final payment of the amount due on the settlement of the termination claim or claims of the war contractor involved or such time thereafter as the contracting agency deems necessary for the liquidation of such interim financing in an orderly manner.

(g) Settlement of claims; validation of prior financing

Any contracting agency may settle, upon such terms and conditions as it deems proper, any claim or obligation due by or to the Government arising from or related to any interim financing made, acquired, or authorized by it.
Any interim financing made, acquired, or authorized by any contracting agency before July 21, 1944, shall be valid to the extent it would be authorized under the provisions of this chapter if made after its effective date.

(a) Any contracting agency may make advance or partial payments to any war contractor on account of any termination claim or claims, and may authorize, approve, or ratify any such advance or partial payments by any war contractor to his subcontractors, upon such conditions as it deems necessary to insure compliance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this section.
Each contracting agency shall make final payments from time to time on partial settlements or on settlements fixing a minimum amount due before complete settlement, or as tentative payments before any settlement of the claim or claims.

(b) Where any such advance or partial payment is made to any war contractor by any contracting agency or by another war contractor under this section, except a final payment on a partial settlement, any amount in excess of the amount finally determined to be due on the termination claim shall be treated as a loan from the Government to the war contractor receiving it, and shall be payable upon demand together with a penalty computed at the rate of 6 per centum per annum, for the period from the date such excess advance or partial payment is received to the date on which such excess is repaid or extinguished.
Where the advance or partial payment was made by a war contractor and authorized, approved, or ratified by any contracting agency, the war contractor making it shall not be liable for any such excess payment in the absence of fraud on his part and shall receive payment or credit from the Government for the amount of such excess payment.

(1) to enter into contracts with any Federal Reserve bank, or other public or private financing institution, guaranteeing such financing institution against loss of principal or interest on loans, discounts, or advances or on commitments in connection therewith, which such financing institution may make to any war contractor or to any person who is or has been engaged in performing any operation deemed by such contracting agency to be connected with or related to war production, for the purpose of financing such war contractor or other person in connection with or in contemplation of the termination of one or more such war contracts or operations; and

(2) to make, enter into contracts to make, or to participate with any Government agency, any Federal Reserve bank or public or private financing institution in making loans, discounts, or advances, or commitments in connection therewith, for the purpose of financing any such war contractor or other person in connection with or in contemplation of the termination of such war contracts or operations.

In order to facilitate the efficient use of materials, manpower, and facilities for war and civilian purposes, each contracting agency—

§112. Removal and storage of materials

(a) Termination inventory

It is the policy of the Government, upon the termination of any war contract, to assure the expeditious removal from the plant of the war contractor of the termination inventory not to be retained or sold by the war contractor.

(b) Statement on material of inventory

Any war contractor may submit to the contracting agency concerned or to any other Government agency designated by the Administrator of General Services, one or more statements showing the materials which such war contractor claims to be termination inventory under one or more war contracts and desires to have removed by the Government.
Such statements shall be prepared in such form and detail, shall be submitted in such manner, through the prime contractor or otherwise, and shall be supported by such certificates or other data, as may be prescribed under this chapter.

(c) Removal and storage by Government agency

Within sixty days after the submission of any such statement by a war contractor, or such shorter period as may be prescribed under this chapter, or within such longer period as the war contractor may agree, the Government agency concerned (1) shall arrange, upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed, for the storage by the war contractor on his own premises or elsewhere of all such claimed termination inventory which the war contractor does not retain or dispose of, except any part which may be determined not to be allocable to the terminated war contract or contracts, or (2) shall remove from the plant or plants of the war contractor all of such claimed termination inventory not retained, disposed of, or stored by the war contractor or determined not to be allocable to the terminated war contract or contracts.

(d) Removal and storage by war contractor

Upon the failure of the Government so to arrange for storage by the war contractor or to remove any termination inventory within the period specified under subsection (c) of this section, the war contractor, subject to regulations prescribed under this chapter, may remove some or all of such termination inventory from his plant or plants and may store it on his own premises or elsewhere for the account and at the risk and expense of the Government, using reasonable care for its transportation and preservation.
If any war contractor intends so to remove any claimed termination inventory, he shall deliver to the Government agency concerned written notice of the date fixed for removal and a statement showing the quantities and condition of the materials so to be removed, certified on behalf of the war contractor to have been prepared in accordance with a concurrent physical inventory of such materials.
Such notice and statement shall be delivered at least twenty days in advance of the date fixed for removal and may be delivered before or after the expiration of the period specified under subsection (c) of this section.
If the Government agency fails to check such materials, at or before the time of their removal by the war contractor, a certificate of the war contractor specifying the materials shown on such statement which were so removed, and filed with the Government agency concerned within thirty days after the date fixed for removal, shall constitute prima facie evidence against the United States as to the quantities and condition of the materials so removed, and the fact of their removal.

(e) Acquisition by Government agency of inventory material; liability

Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, but subject to subsection (h) of this section, the contracting agency concerned or the Administrator of General Services, or any Government agency designated by him, on behalf of the United States, may, by the exercise of any contract rights or otherwise, acquire and take possession of any termination inventory of any war contractor, and any materials removed by the Government or stored for its account under subsections (c) and (d) of this section, whether or not such materials are finally determined not to constitute termination inventory.
With respect to any such materials, the Government shall be liable to any war contractor concerned only for their return to such war contractor or for their disposal value at the time of their removal or for the proceeds realized by the Government from their disposal, at the election of the Government agency concerned, unless the Government agency and the war contractor agree or have agreed on a different basis.
Any amount so paid or payable to a war contractor for materials allocable to a terminated war contract shall be credited against the termination claim under such contract but shall not otherwise affect the amount due on the claim, unless the Government agency concerned and the war contractor agree or have agreed otherwise.
Any materials to which the Administrator of General Services takes title under this section shall be delivered for disposal to any appropriate Government agency authorized to make such disposal.

(f) Postponement or delay of termination settlement

No contracting agency shall postpone or delay any termination settlement beyond the period specified in subsection (c) of this section for the purpose of awaiting disposal by the war contractor or the Government of any termination inventory reported in accordance with subsection (b) of this section.

(g) Government-owned machinery

Whenever any war contractor no longer requires, for the performance of any war contract, any Government-owned machinery, tools, or equipment installed in his plant for the performance of one or more war contracts, the Government agency concerned, upon written demand by the war contractor, and within sixty days after such demand or such other period as may be prescribed under this chapter, and upon such conditions as may be so prescribed, shall remove or provide for the removal of such machinery, tools, or equipment from such plant, unless the Government agency concerned and the war contractor, by facilities contract or otherwise, have made or make other provisions for the retention, storage, maintenance, or disposition of such machinery, tools or equipment.
The Government agency concerned may waive or release on behalf of the United States any obligation of the war contractor with respect to such machinery, tools, or equipment upon such terms and conditions as the agency deems appropriate.
Upon the failure of the Government so to remove or provide for removal of any such machinery, tools, or equipment, the war contractor, subject to regulations prescribed under this chapter, may remove all or part of such machinery, tools, or equipment from his plant and may store it on his own premises or elsewhere, for the account and at the risk and expense of the Government, using reasonable care for its transportation and preservation.

(h) Limitation on Government acquisition of inventories

Nothing in this chapter shall limit or affect the authority of the Department of the Army, Department of the Air Force, Navy Department, or the Department of Transportation, respectively, to take over any termination inventories and to retain them for their use for any purpose or to dispose of such termination inventories for the purpose of war production, or to authorize any war contractor to retain or dispose of such termination inventories for the purpose of war production.

(i) Removal and storage by war contractor at own risk

Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the removal and storage of any termination inventory by any war contractor, at his own risk, at any time after termination of any war contract to which it is allocable.

Application to Terminated War Contracts

For application of subsecs. (b) to (e) of this section to war contracts terminated at or before July 21, 1944, see section 124 of this title.

§113. Appeals

(a) Failure to settle claims by agreement; preparation of findings; notice to war contractor

Whenever the contracting agency responsible for settling any termination claim has not settled the claim by agreement or has so settled only a part of the claim, (1) the contracting agency at any time may determine the amount due on such claim or such unsettled part, and prepare written findings indicating the basis of the determination, and deliver a copy of such findings to the war contractor, or (2) if the termination claim has been submitted in the manner and substantially the form prescribed under this chapter, the contracting agency, upon written demand by the war contractor for such findings, shall determine the amount due on the claim or unsettled part and prepare and deliver such findings to the war contractor within ninety days after the receipt by the agency of such demand.
In preparing such findings, the contracting agency may require the war contractor to furnish such information and to submit to such audits as may be reasonably necessary for that purpose.
Within thirty days after the delivery of any such findings, the contracting agency shall pay to the war contractor at least 90 per centum of the amount thereby determined to be due, after deducting the amount of any outstanding interim financing applicable thereto.

(b) Rights of war contractor

Whenever any war contractor is aggrieved by the findings of a contracting agency on his claim or part thereof or by its failure to make such findings in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, he may bring suit against the United States for such claim or such part thereof, in the United States Court of Federal Claims or in a United States district court, in accordance with sections 1346, 2401, and 2402 of title 28, except that, if the contracting agency is the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, or any corporation organized pursuant to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation Act, or any corporation owned or controlled by the United States, the suit shall be brought against such corporation in any court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with existing law.

(c) Procedure

Any proceeding under subsection (b) of this section shall be governed by the following conditions:

(1) When any contracting agency provides a procedure within the agency for protest against such findings or for other appeal therefrom by the war contractor, the war contractor, before proceeding under subsection (b) of this section, (i) in his discretion may resort to such procedure within the time specified in his contract or, if no time is specified, within thirty days after the delivery to him of the findings; and (ii) shall resort to such procedure for protest or other appeal to the extent required by the Administrator of General Services, but failure of the contracting agency to act on any such required protest or appeal within thirty days shall operate as a refusal by the agency to modify its findings.
Any revision of the findings by the contracting agency, upon protest or appeal within the agency, shall be treated as the findings of the agency for the purpose of appeal or suit under subsection (b) of this section.
Notwithstanding any contrary provision in any war contract, no war contractor shall be required to protest or appeal from such findings within the contracting agency except in accordance with this paragraph.

(2) A war contractor may initiate proceedings in accordance with subsection (b) of this section (i) within ninety days after delivery to him of the findings by the contracting agency, or (ii) in case of protests or appeal within the agency, within ninety days after the determination of such protest or appeal, or (iii) in case of failure to deliver such findings, within one year after his demand therefor.
If he does not initiate such proceedings within the time specified, he shall be precluded thereafter from initiating any proceedings in accordance with subsection (b) of this section, and the findings of the contracting agency shall be final and conclusive, or if no findings were made, he shall be deemed to have waived such termination claim.

(3) Notwithstanding any contrary provision in any war contract, the court shall not be bound by the findings of the contracting agency, but shall treat such findings as prima facie correct, and the burden shall be on the war contractor to establish that the amount due on his claim or part thereof exceeds the amount allowed by the findings of the contracting agency.
Whenever the court finds that the war contractor failed to negotiate in good faith with the contracting agency for the settlement of his claim or part thereof before appeal or suit thereon, or failed to furnish to the agency any information reasonably requested by it regarding his termination claim or part thereof, or failed to prosecute diligently any protest or appeal required to be taken under subsection (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the court (i) may refuse to receive in evidence any information not submitted to the contracting agency; (ii) may deny interest on the claim or part thereof for such period as it deems proper; or (iii) may remand the case to the contracting agency for further proceedings upon such terms as the court may prescribe.
Unless the case is remanded, the court shall enter the appropriate award or judgment on the basis of the law and facts, and may increase or decrease the amount allowed by the findings of the contracting agency.

(4) Any such proceedings shall not affect the authority of the contracting agency concerned to make a settlement of the termination claim, or any part thereof, by agreement with the war contractor at any time before such proceedings are concluded.

(d) Omitted

(e) Arbitration

The contracting agency responsible for settling any claim and the war contractor asserting the claim, by agreement, may submit all or any part of the termination claim to arbitration, without regard to the amount in dispute.
Such arbitration proceedings shall be governed by the provisions of United States Arbitration Act to the same extent as if authorized by an effective agreement in writing between the Government and the war contractor.
Any such arbitration award shall be final and conclusive upon the United States to the same extent as a settlement under subsection (c) of section 106 of this title, but shall not be subject to approval by any settlement review board.

(f) Conclusiveness of decisions

Whenever any dispute exists between any war contractor and a subcontractor regarding any termination claim, either of them, by agreement with the other, may submit the dispute to a contracting agency for mediation or arbitration whenever authorized by the agency or required by the Administrator of General Services.

Any award or decision in such proceedings shall be final and conclusive as to the parties so submitting any such dispute and shall not be questioned by the United States in settling any related claim, in the absence of fraud or collusion.

Upon appearance by any person pursuant to any such summons or notice, the case as to such person shall, for all purposes, be treated as if an independent proceeding has been instituted by such person pursuant to sections 1491, 1496, 1501, 1503, and 2501 of title 28, and as if such independent proceeding had then been consolidated, for purposes of trial and determination, with the case in respect of which the summons or notice was issued, except that the United States shall not be heard upon any counterclaims, claims for damages or other demands whatsoever against such person, other than claims and contingent claims for the recovery of money hereafter paid by the United States in respect of the transaction or matter which constitutes the subject matter of such case, unless and until such person shall assert therein a claim, or an interest in a claim, against the United States, and the United States Court of Federal Claims shall have jurisdiction to adjudicate, as between any and all adverse claimants, their respective several interests in any matter in suit and to award several judgments in accordance therewith.

(c) Jurisdiction

The jurisdiction of the United States Court of Federal Claims shall not be affected by this chapter except to the extent necessary to give effect to this chapter, and no person shall recover judgment on any claim, or on any interest in any claim, in said court which such person would not have had a right to assert in said court if this section had not been enacted.

Thereupon, (1) the Department of Justice shall make an investigation to determine whether such settlement was induced by fraud, and (2) until the Department of Justice notifies the contracting agency that in its opinion the facts do not support the belief that the settlement was induced by fraud, the contracting agency, by set-off or otherwise, may withhold, from amounts owing to the war contractor by the United States under such settlement or otherwise, the amount of the settlement, or the portion thereof, which, in its opinion, was affected by the fraud.
In any such case the Department of Justice shall take such action as it deems appropriate to recover payments made to such war contractor.

(b) of section 19 was classified to section 590a of Title 18, Criminal Code and Criminal Procedure, prior to the general revision and enactment of Title 18, Crimes and Criminal Procedure, by act June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 683.

Any contracting agency may authorize or direct its officers and employees, as a part of their official duties, to advise, aid, and assist war contractors in preparing and presenting termination claims, in obtaining interim financing, and in related matters, to such extent as it deems desirable.

No. 13005. Empowerment Contracting

Ex. Ord.
No. 13005, May 21, 1996, 61 F.R. 26069, provided:

In order to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, it is necessary to secure broad-based competition for Federal contracts.
This broad competition is best achieved where there is an expansive pool of potential contractors capable of producing quality goods and services at competitive prices.
A great and largely untapped opportunity for expanding the pool of such contractors can be found in this Nation's economically distressed communities.

Fostering growth of Federal contractors in economically distressed communities and ensuring that those contractors become viable businesses for the long term will promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement and help to empower those communities.
Fostering growth of long-term viable contractors will be promoted by offering appropriate incentives to qualified businesses.

Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 486(a) [now 121(a)] of title 40, United States Code, and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:

Section 1. Policy.
The purpose of this order is to strengthen the economy and to improve the efficiency of the Federal procurement system by encouraging business development that expands the industrial base and increases competition.

In consultation with the Secretaries of the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Labor, and Defense; the Administrator of General Services; the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; the Administrator of the Small Business Administration; and the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, the Secretary of the Department of Commerce shall develop policies and procedures to ensure that agencies, to the extent permitted by law, grant qualified large businesses and qualified small businesses appropriate incentives to encourage business activity in areas of general economic distress, including a price or an evaluation credit, when assessing offers for government contracts in unrestricted competitions, where the incentives would promote the policy set forth in this order.
In developing such policies and procedures, the Secretary shall consider the size of the qualified businesses.

Sec. 3. Monitoring and Evaluation.
The Secretary shall:

(a) monitor the implementation and operation of the policies and procedures developed in accordance with this order;

(b) develop a process to ensure the proper administration of the program and to reduce the potential for fraud by the intended beneficiaries of the program;

(c) develop principles and a process to evaluate the effectiveness of the policies and procedures developed in accordance with this order; and

(d) by December 1 of each year, issue a report to the President on the status and effectiveness of the program.

Sec. 4. Implementation Guidelines.
In implementing this order, the Secretary shall:

(a) issue rules, regulations, and guidelines necessary to implement this order, including a requirement for the periodic review of the eligibility of qualified businesses and distressed areas;

(b) draft all rules, regulations, and guidelines necessary to implement this order within 90 days of the date of this order; and

(c) ensure that all policies and procedures and all rules, regulations, and guidelines adopted and implemented in accordance with this order minimize the administrative burden on affected agencies and the procurement process.

Sec. 5. Definitions.
For purposes of this Executive order:

(a) “Agency” means any authority of the United States that is an “agency” under 44 U.S.C. 3502(1), other than those considered to be independent regulatory agencies, as defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(10).

(b) “Area of general economic distress” shall be defined, for all urban and rural communities, as any census tract that has a poverty rate of at least 20 percent or any designated Federal Empowerment Zone, Supplemental Empowerment Zone, Enhanced Enterprise Community, or Enterprise Community.
In addition, the Secretary may designate as an area of general economic distress any additional rural or Indian reservation area after considering the following factors:

(d) “Qualified small business” means a small for-profit or not-for-profit trade or business that (1) employs a significant number of residents from the area of general economic distress; (2) has a significant physical presence in the area of general economic distress; or (3) has a direct impact on generating significant economic activity in the area of general economic distress.

(e) “Secretary” means the Secretary of Commerce.

Sec. 6. Agency Authority.
Nothing in this Executive order shall be construed as displacing the agencies’ authority or responsibilities, as authorized by law, including specifically other programs designed to promote the development of small or disadvantaged businesses.

Sec. 5. (a) The head of an executive agency may exempt a particular project, contract, subcontract, grant, or cooperative agreement from the requirements of any or all of the provisions of sections 1 and 3 of this order, if the agency head finds that special circumstances require an exemption in order to avert an imminent threat to public health or safety or to serve the national security.

(b) A finding of “special circumstances” under section 5(a) may not be based on the possibility or presence of a labor dispute concerning the use of contractors or subcontractors who are nonsignatories to, or otherwise do not adhere to, agreements with one or more labor organizations, or concerning employees on the project who are not members of or affiliated with a labor organization.

(c) The head of an executive agency, upon application of an awarding authority, a recipient of grants or financial assistance, a party to a cooperative agreement, or a construction manager acting on behalf of the foregoing, may exempt a particular project from the requirements of any or all of the provisions of sections 1 and 3 of this order, if the agency head finds: (i) that the awarding authority, recipient of grants or financial assistance, party to a cooperative agreement, or construction manager acting on behalf of the foregoing had issued or was a party to, as of the date of this order, bid specifications, project agreements, agreements with one or more labor organizations, or other controlling documents with respect to that particular project, which contained any of the requirements or prohibitions set forth in sections 1(a) or (b) of this order; and (ii) that one or more construction contracts subject to such requirements or prohibitions had been awarded as of the date of this order.

§253. Competition requirements

(a) Procurement through full and open competition; competitive procedures

(1) Except as provided in subsections (b), (c), and (g) of this section and except in the case of procurement procedures otherwise expressly authorized by statute, an executive agency in conducting a procurement for property or services—

(A) shall obtain full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter and the Federal Acquisition Regulation; and

(B) shall use the competitive procedure or combination of competitive procedures that is best suited under the circumstances of the procurement.

(2) In determining the competitive procedures appropriate under the circumstance, an executive agency—

(A) shall solicit sealed bids if—

(i) time permits the solicitation, submission, and evaluation of sealed bids;

(ii) the award will be made on the basis of price and other price-related factors;

(iii) it is not necessary to conduct discussions with the responding sources about their bids; and

(iv) there is a reasonable expectation of receiving more than one sealed bid; and

(B) shall request competitive proposals if sealed bids are not appropriate under clause (A).

(b) Exclusion of particular source; restriction of solicitation to small business concerns

(1) An executive agency may provide for the procurement of property or services covered by this section using competitive procedures but excluding a particular source in order to establish or maintain any alternative source or sources of supply for that property or service if the agency head determines that to do so—

(A) would increase or maintain competition and would likely result in reduced overall costs for such procurement, or for any anticipated procurement, of such property or services;

(B) would be in the interest of national defense in having a facility (or a producer, manufacturer, or other supplier) available for furnishing the property or service in case of a national emergency or industrial mobilization;

(C) would be in the interest of national defense in establishing or maintaining an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a federally funded research and development center;

(D) would ensure the continuous availability of a reliable source of supply of such property or service;

(E) would satisfy projected needs for such property or service determined on the basis of a history of high demand for the property or service; or

(F) in the case of medical supplies, safety supplies, or emergency supplies, would satisfy a critical need for such supplies.

(2) An executive agency may provide for the procurement of property or services covered by this section using competitive procedures, but excluding other than small business concerns in furtherance of sections 638 and 644 of title 15.

(3) A contract awarded pursuant to the competitive procedures referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not be subject to the justification and approval required by subsection (f)(1) of this section.

(4) A determination under paragraph (1) may not be made for a class of purchases or contracts.

(c) Use of noncompetitive procedures

An executive agency may use procedures other than competitive procedures only when—

(1) the property or services needed by the executive agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the executive agency;

(2) the executive agency's need for the property or services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured unless the executive agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals;

(3) it is necessary to award the contract to a particular source or sources in order (A) to maintain a facility, producer, manufacturer, or other supplier available for furnishing property or services in case of a national emergency or to achieve industrial mobilization, (B) to establish or maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a federally funded research and development center, or (C) to procure the services of an expert for use, in any litigation or dispute (including any reasonably foreseeable litigation or dispute) involving the Federal Government, in any trial, hearing, or proceeding before any court, administrative tribunal, or agency, or to procure the services of an expert or neutral for use in any part of an alternative dispute resolution or negotiated rulemaking process, whether or not the expert is expected to testify;

(4) the terms of an international agreement or treaty between the United States Government and a foreign government or international organization, or the written directions of a foreign government reimbursing the executive agency for the cost of the procurement of the property or services for such government, have the effect of requiring the use of procedures other than competitive procedures;

(5) subject to subsection (h) 1 of this section, a statute expressly authorizes or requires that the procurement be made through another executive agency or from a specified source, or the agency's need is for a brand-name commercial item for authorized resale;

(6) the disclosure of the executive agency's needs would compromise the national security unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals; or

(7) the head of the executive agency—

(A) determines that it is necessary in the public interest to use procedures other than competitive procedures in the particular procurement concerned, and

(B) notifies the Congress in writing of such determination not less than 30 days before the award of the contract.

(d) Property or services deemed available from only one source; nondelegable authority

(1) For the purposes of applying subsection (c)(1) of this section—

(A) in the case of a contract for property or services to be awarded on the basis of acceptance of an unsolicited research proposal, the property or services shall be considered to be available from only one source if the source has submitted an unsolicited research proposal that demonstrates a unique and innovative concept the substance of which is not otherwise available to the United States and does not resemble the substance of a pending competitive procurement; and

(B) in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment when it is likely that award to a source other than the original source would result in (i) substantial duplication of cost to the Government which is not expected to be recovered through competition, or (ii) unacceptable delays in fulfilling the executive agency's needs, such property may be deemed to be available only from the original source and may be procured through procedures other than competitive procedures.

(2) The authority of the head of an executive agency under subsection (c)(7) of this section may not be delegated.

(e) Offer requests to potential sources

An executive agency using procedures other than competitive procedures to procure property or services by reason of the application of subsection (c)(2) or (c)(6) of this section shall request offers from as many potential sources as is practicable under the circumstances.

(f) Justification for use of noncompetitive procedures

(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), an executive agency may not award a contract using procedures other than competitive procedures unless—

(A) the contracting officer for the contract justifies the use of such procedures in writing and certifies the accuracy and completeness of the justification;

(B) the justification is approved—

(i) in the case of a contract for an amount exceeding $500,000 (but equal to or less than $10,000,000), by the competition advocate for the procuring activity (without further delegation) or by an official referred to in clause (ii) or (iii); and

(ii) in the case of a contract for an amount exceeding $10,000,000 (but equal to or less than $50,000,000), by the head of the procuring activity or a delegate who, if a member of the armed forces, is a general or flag officer or, if a civilian, is serving in a position in grade GS–16 or above under the General Schedule (or in a comparable or higher position under another schedule); or

(iii) in the case of a contract for an amount exceeding $50,000,000, by the senior procurement executive of the agency designated pursuant to section 414(3) 1 of this title (without further delegation); and

(C) any required notice has been published with respect to such contract pursuant to section 416 of this title and all bids or proposals received in response to such notice have been considered by such executive agency.

(2) In the case of a procurement permitted by subsection (c)(2), the justification and approval required by paragraph (1) may be made after the contract is awarded.
The justification and approval required by paragraph (1) is not required—

(A) when a statute expressly requires that the procurement be made from a specified source;

(B) when the agency's need is for a brand-name commercial item for authorized resale;

(C) in the case of a procurement permitted by subsection (c)(7) of this section; or

(D) in the case of a procurement conducted under (i) the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 U.S.C. 46 et seq.), or (ii) section 637(a) of title 15.

(E) a listing of the sources, if any, that expressed in writing an interest in the procurement; and

(F) a statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome a barrier to competition before a subsequent procurement for such needs.

(4) The justification required by paragraph (1)(A) and any related information shall be made available for inspection by the public consistent with the provisions of section 552 of title 5.

(5) In no case may an executive agency—

(A) enter into a contract for property or services using procedures other than competitive procedures on the basis of the lack of advance planning or concerns related to the amount of funds available to the agency for procurement functions; or

(B) procure property or services from another executive agency unless such other executive agency complies fully with the requirements of this subchapter in its procurement of such property or services.

The restriction set out in clause (B) is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other restriction provided by law.

(g) Simplified procedures for small purchases

(1) In order to promote efficiency and economy in contracting and to avoid unnecessary burdens for agencies and contractors, the Federal Acquisition Regulation shall provide for—

(A) special simplified procedures for purchases of property and services for amounts not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold; and

(B) special simplified procedures for purchases of property and services for amounts greater than the simplified acquisition threshold but not greater than $5,000,000 with respect to which the contracting officer reasonably expects, based on the nature of the property or services sought and on market research, that offers will include only commercial items.

(2)(A) The Administrator of General Services shall prescribe regulations that provide special simplified procedures for acquisitions of leasehold interests in real property at rental rates that do not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.

(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the rental rate or rates under a multiyear lease do not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold if the average annual amount of the rent payable for the period of the lease does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.

(3) A proposed purchase or contract for an amount above the simplified acquisition threshold may not be divided into several purchases or contracts for lesser amounts in order to use the simplified procedures required by paragraph (1).

(4) In using the simplified procedures, an executive agency shall promote competition to the maximum extent practicable.

(5) An executive agency shall comply with the Federal Acquisition Regulation provisions referred to in section 427(f) of this title.

(h) Efficient implementation of requirement

The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall ensure that the requirement to obtain full and open competition is implemented in a manner that is consistent with the need to efficiently fulfill the Government's requirements.

(i) Merit-based award of contracts

(1) It is the policy of Congress that an executive agency should not be required by legislation to award a new contract to a specific non-Federal Government entity.
It is further the policy of Congress that any program, project, or technology identified in legislation be procured through merit-based selection procedures.

(2) A provision of law may not be construed as requiring a new contract to be awarded to a specified non-Federal Government entity unless that provision of law—

(A) specifically refers to this subsection;

(B) specifically identifies the particular non-Federal Government entity involved; and

(C) specifically states that the award to that entity is required by such provision of law in contravention of the policy set forth in paragraph (1).

(B) include restrictive provisions or conditions only to the extent necessary to satisfy the needs of the executive agency or as authorized by law.

(3) For the purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2), the type of specification included in a solicitation shall depend on the nature of the needs of the executive agency and the market available to satisfy such needs.

In addition to the specifications described in subsection (a) of this section, each solicitation for sealed bids or competitive proposals (other than for a procurement for commercial items using special simplified procedures or a purchase for an amount not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold) shall at a minimum include—

(1) a statement of—

(A) all significant factors and significant subfactors which the executive agency reasonably expects to consider in evaluating sealed bids (including price) or competitive proposals (including cost or price, cost-related or price-related factors and subfactors, and noncost-related or nonprice-related factors and subfactors); and

(B) the relative importance assigned to each of those factors and subfactors; and

(2)(A) in the case of sealed bids—

(i) a statement that sealed bids will be evaluated without discussions with the bidders; and

(ii) the time and place for submission of proposals.

(c) Evaluation factors

(1) In prescribing the evaluation factors to be included in each solicitation for competitive proposals, an executive agency—

(2) If the contracting officer determines that the number of offerors that would otherwise be included in the competitive range under paragraph (1)(A) exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the contracting officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range, in accordance with the criteria specified in the solicitation, to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the offerors rated most highly in accordance with such criteria.

If such proposals are required, the head of the agency shall consider them in evaluating the offeror's price.

(B) The proposals that the head of an agency is to consider requiring in a solicitation for the award of a production contract are proposals identifying opportunities to ensure that the United States will be able to obtain on a competitive basis items procured in connection with the system that are likely to be reprocured in substantial quantities during the service life of the system.
Proposals submitted in response to such requirement may include the following:

(i) Proposals to provide to the United States the right to use technical data to be provided under the contract for competitive reprocurement of the item, together with the cost to the United States, if any, of acquiring such technical data and the right to use such data.

No. 12979. Agency Procurement Protests

Ex. Ord.
No. 12979, Oct. 25, 1995, 60 F.R. 55171, provided:

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to ensure effective and efficient expenditure of public funds and fair and expeditious resolution of protests to the award of Federal procurement contracts, it is hereby ordered as follows:

Section 1. Heads of executive departments and agencies (“agencies”) engaged in the procurement of supplies and services shall prescribe administrative procedures for the resolution of protests to the award of their procurement contracts as an alternative to protests in fora outside the procuring agencies.
Procedures prescribed pursuant to this order shall:

(a) emphasize that whenever conduct of a procurement is contested, all parties should use their best efforts to resolve the matter with agency contracting officers;

(b) to the maximum extent practicable, provide for inexpensive, informal, procedurally simple, and expeditious resolution of protests, including, where appropriate and as permitted by law, the use of alternative dispute resolution techniques, third party neutrals, and another agency's personnel;

(c) allow actual or prospective bidders or offerors whose direct economic interests would be affected by the award or failure to award the contract to request a review, at a level above the contracting officer, of any decision by a contracting officer that is alleged to have violated a statute or regulation and, thereby, caused prejudice to the protester; and

(d) except where immediate contract award or performance is justified for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined to be in the best interest of the United States, prohibit award or performance of the contract while a timely filed protest is pending before the agency.
To allow for the withholding of a contract award or performance, the agency must have received notice of the protest within either 10 calendar days after the contract award or 5 calendar days after the bidder or offeror who is protesting the contract award was given the opportunity to be debriefed by the agency, whichever date is later.

Sec. 2. The Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy shall: (a) work with the heads of executive agencies to provide policy guidance and leadership necessary to implement provisions of this order; and

(b) review and evaluate agency experience and performance under this order, and report on any findings to the President within 2 years from the date of this order.

Sec. 3. The Administrator of General Services, the Secretary of Defense, and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, in coordination with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, shall amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation, 48 C.F.R. 1, within 180 days of the date of this order to further the purposes of this order.

William J. Clinton.      

Definitions

The definitions in section 102 of Title 40, Public Buildings, Property, and Works, apply to this subchapter.

§253c. Encouragement of new competition

(a) “Qualification requirement” defined

In this section, “qualification requirement” means a requirement for testing or other quality assurance demonstration that must be completed by an offeror before award of a contract.

(b) Agency head; functions; prior to enforcement of qualification requirement

Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the head of the agency shall, before enforcing any qualification requirement—

(1) prepare a written justification stating the necessity for establishing the qualification requirement and specify why the qualification requirement must be demonstrated before contract award;

(2) specify in writing and make available to a potential offeror upon request all requirements which a prospective offeror, or its product, must satisfy in order to become qualified, such requirements to be limited to those least restrictive to meet the purposes necessitating the establishment of the qualification requirement;

(3) specify an estimate of the costs of testing and evaluation likely to be incurred by a potential offeror in order to become qualified;

(4) ensure that a potential offeror is provided, upon request, a prompt opportunity to demonstrate at its own expense (except as provided in subsection (d) of this section) its ability to meet the standards specified for qualification using qualified personnel and facilities of the agency concerned or of another agency obtained through interagency agreement, or under contract, or other methods approved by the agency (including use of approved testing and evaluation services not provided under contract to the agency);

(5) if testing and evaluation services are provided under contract to the agency for the purposes of clause (4), provide to the extent possible that such services be provided by a contractor who is not expected to benefit from an absence of additional qualified sources and who shall be required in such contract to adhere to any restriction on technical data asserted by the potential offeror seeking qualification; and

(6) ensure that a potential offeror seeking qualification is promptly informed as to whether qualification is attained and, in the event qualification is not attained, is promptly furnished specific information why qualification was not attained.

(c) Applicability; waiver authority; referral of offers

(1) Subsection (b) of this section does not apply with respect to a qualification requirement established by statute prior to October 30, 1984.

(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), if it is unreasonable to specify the standards for qualification which a prospective offeror or its product must satisfy, a determination to that effect shall be submitted to the advocate for competition of the procuring activity responsible for the purchase of the item subject to the qualification requirement.
After considering any comments of the advocate for competition reviewing such determination, the head of the procuring activity may waive the requirements of paragraphs (2) through (5) of subsection (b) of this section for up to two years with respect to the item subject to the qualification requirement.

(3) The waiver authority contained in paragraph (2) shall not apply with respect to any qualified products list.

(4) A potential offeror may not be denied the opportunity to submit and have considered an offer for a contract solely because the potential offeror has not been identified as meeting a qualification requirement, if the potential offeror can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the contracting officer that the potential offeror or its product meets the standards established for qualification or can meet such standards before the date specified for award of the contract.

(5) Nothing contained in this subsection requires the referral of an offer to the Small Business Administration pursuant to section 637(b)(7) of title 15 if the basis for the referral is a challenge by the offeror to either the validity of the qualification requirement or the offeror's compliance with such requirement.

(6) The head of an agency need not delay a proposed procurement in order to comply with subsection (b) of this section or in order to provide a potential offeror with an opportunity to demonstrate its ability to meet the standards specified for qualification.

(d) Number; qualified sources or products; fewer than two actual manufacturers; functions of agency head

(1) If the number of qualified sources or qualified products available to compete actively for an anticipated future requirement is fewer than two actual manufacturers or the products of two actual manufacturers, respectively, the head of the agency concerned shall—

(A) periodically publish notice in the Commerce Business Daily soliciting additional sources or products to seek qualification, unless the contracting officer determines that such publication would compromise national security; and

(B) bear the cost of conducting the specified testing and evaluation (excluding the costs associated with producing the item or establishing the production, quality control, or other system to be tested and evaluated) for a small business concern or a product manufactured by a small business concern which has met the standards specified for qualification and which could reasonably be expected to compete for a contract for that requirement, but such costs may be borne only if the head of the agency determines that such additional qualified sources or products are likely to result in cost savings from increased competition for future requirements sufficient to offset (within a reasonable period of time considering the duration and dollar value of anticipated future requirements) the costs incurred by the agency.

(2) The head of an agency shall require a prospective contractor requesting the United States to bear testing and evaluation costs under paragraph (1)(B) to certify as to its status as a small business concern under section 632 of title 15.

(e) Examination; need for qualification requirement

Within seven years after the establishment of a qualification requirement, the need for such qualification requirement shall be examined and the standards of such requirement revalidated in accordance with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section.
The preceding sentence does not apply in the case of a qualification requirement for which a waiver is in effect under subsection (c)(2) of this section.

(f) Enforcement determination by agency head

Except in an emergency as determined by the head of the agency, whenever the head of the agency determines not to enforce a qualification requirement for a solicitation, the agency may not thereafter enforce that qualification requirement unless the agency complies with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section.

§253d. Validation of proprietary data restrictions

(a) Contracts; delivery of technical services; contents

A contract for property or services entered into by an executive agency which provides for the delivery of technical data, shall provide that—

(1) a contractor or subcontractor at any tier shall be prepared to furnish to the contracting officer a written justification for any restriction asserted by the contractor or subcontractor on the right of the United States to use such technical data; and

(2) the contracting officer may review the validity of any restriction asserted by the contractor or by a subcontractor under the contract on the right of the United States to use technical data furnished to the United States under the contract if the contracting officer determines that reasonable grounds exist to question the current validity of the asserted restriction and that the continued adherence to the asserted restriction by the United States would make it impracticable to procure the item competitively at a later time.

(b) Review; challenge; notice

If after such review the contracting officer determines that a challenge to the asserted restriction is warranted, the contracting officer shall provide written notice to the contractor or subcontractor asserting the restriction.
Such notice shall state—

(1) the grounds for challenging the asserted restriction; and

(2) the requirement for a response within 60 days justifying the current validity of the asserted restriction.

(c) Written request; additional time; schedule of responses

If a contractor or subcontractor asserting a restriction subject to this section submits to the contracting officer a written request, showing the need for additional time to comply with the requirement to justify the current validity of the asserted restriction, additional time to adequately permit the submission of such justification shall be provided by the contracting officer as appropriate.
If a party asserting a restriction receives notices of challenges to restrictions on technical data from more than one contracting officer, and notifies each contracting officer of the existence of more than one challenge, the contracting officer initiating the first in time challenge, after consultation with the party asserting the restriction and the other contracting officers, shall formulate a schedule of responses to each of the challenges that will afford the party asserting the restriction with an equitable opportunity to respond to each such challenge.

(d) Decision; validity of asserted restriction; failure to submit response

(1) Upon a failure by the contractor or subcontractor to submit any response under subsection (b) of this section, the contracting officer shall issue a decision pertaining to the validity of the asserted restriction.

(2) If a justification is submitted in response to the notice provided pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, a contracting officer shall within 60 days of receipt of any justification submitted, issue a decision or notify the party asserting the restriction of the time within which a decision will be issued.

(e) Claim; considered claim within Contract Disputes Act of 1978

If a claim pertaining to the validity of the asserted restriction is submitted in writing to a contracting officer by a contractor or subcontractor at any tier, such claim shall be considered a claim within the meaning of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 601 et seq.).

(f) Challenge; use of technical data; sustained; liability of United States for costs and fees

(1) If, upon final disposition, the contracting officer's challenge to the restriction on the right of the United States to use such technical data is sustained—

(A) the restriction on the right of the United States to use the technical data shall be cancelled; and

(B) if the asserted restriction is found not to be substantially justified, the contractor or subcontractor, as appropriate, shall be liable to the United States for payment of the cost to the United States of reviewing the asserted restriction and the fees and other expenses (as defined in section 2412(d)(2)(A) of title 28) incurred by the United States in challenging the asserted restriction, unless special circumstances would make such payment unjust.

(2) If, upon final disposition, the contracting officer's challenge to the restriction on the right of the United States to use such technical data is not sustained—

(A) the United States shall continue to be bound by the restriction; and

(B) the United States shall be liable for payment to the party asserting the restriction for fees and other expenses (as defined in section 2412(d)(2)(A) of title 28) incurred by the party asserting the restriction in defending the asserted restriction if the challenge by the United States is found not to be made in good faith.

§253g. Prohibition of contractors limiting subcontractor sales directly to United States

(a) Contract restrictions

Each contract for the purchase of property or services made by an executive agency shall provide that the contractor will not—

(1) enter into any agreement with a subcontractor under the contract that has the effect of unreasonably restricting sales by the subcontractor directly to the United States of any item or process (including computer software) made or furnished by the subcontractor under the contract (or any follow-on production contract); or

(2) otherwise act to restrict unreasonably the ability of a subcontractor to make sales to the United States described in clause (1).

(b) Rights under law

This section does not prohibit a contractor from asserting rights it otherwise has under law.

(c) Inapplicability to certain contracts

This section does not apply to a contract for an amount that is not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold.

(d) Inapplicability when Government treated similarly to other purchasers

An agreement between the contractor in a contract for the acquisition of commercial items and a subcontractor under such contract that restricts sales by such subcontractor directly to persons other than the contractor may not be considered to unreasonably restrict sales by that subcontractor to the United States in violation of the provision included in such contract pursuant to subsection (a) of this section if the agreement does not result in the Federal Government being treated differently with regard to the restriction than any other prospective purchaser of such commercial items from that subcontractor.

(c) Content of notice

The notice required by section 416 of this title and section 637(e) of title 15 shall reasonably and fairly describe the general scope, magnitude, and duration of the proposed task order contract in a manner that would reasonably enable a potential offeror to decide whether to request the solicitation and consider submitting an offer.

(d) Required content of solicitation and contract

(1) The solicitation shall include the information (regarding services) described in section 253h(b) of this title.

(2) A task order contract entered into under this section shall contain the same information that is required by paragraph (1) to be included in the solicitation of offers for that contract.

(2) If, in the case of a task order contract for advisory and assistance services to be entered into under the authority of this section, the contract period is to exceed three years and the contract amount is estimated to exceed $10,000,000 (including all options), the solicitation shall—

(A) provide for a multiple award authorized under paragraph (1); and

§253m. Design-build selection procedures

(a) Authorization

Unless the traditional acquisition approach of design-bid-build established under sections 1101 to 1104 of title 40 is used or another acquisition procedure authorized by law is used, the head of an executive agency shall use the two-phase selection procedures authorized in this section for entering into a contract for the design and construction of a public building, facility, or work when a determination is made under subsection (b) of this section that the procedures are appropriate for use.

(b) Criteria for use

A contracting officer shall make a determination whether two-phase selection procedures are appropriate for use for entering into a contract for the design and construction of a public building, facility, or work when the contracting officer anticipates that three or more offers will be received for such contract, design work must be performed before an offeror can develop a price or cost proposal for such contract, the offeror will incur a substantial amount of expense in preparing the offer, and the contracting officer has considered information such as the following:

(1) The extent to which the project requirements have been adequately defined.

(2) The time constraints for delivery of the project.

(3) The capability and experience of potential contractors.

(4) The suitability of the project for use of the two-phase selection procedures.

(5) The capability of the agency to manage the two-phase selection process.

(6) Other criteria established by the agency.

(c) Procedures described

Two-phase selection procedures consist of the following:

(1) The agency develops, either in-house or by contract, a scope of work statement for inclusion in the solicitation that defines the project and provides prospective offerors with sufficient information regarding the Government's requirements (which may include criteria and preliminary design, budget parameters, and schedule or delivery requirements) to enable the offerors to submit proposals which meet the Government's needs.
If the agency contracts for development of the scope of work statement, the agency shall contract for architectural and engineering services as defined by and in accordance with sections 1101 to 1104 of title 40.

(2) The contracting officer solicits phase-one proposals that—

(A) include information on the offeror's—

(i) technical approach; and

(ii) technical qualifications; and

(B) do not include—

(i) detailed design information; or

(ii) cost or price information.

(3) The evaluation factors to be used in evaluating phase-one proposals are stated in the solicitation and include specialized experience and technical competence, capability to perform, past performance of the offeror's team (including the architect-engineer and construction members of the team) and other appropriate factors, except that cost-related or price-related evaluation factors are not permitted.
Each solicitation establishes the relative importance assigned to the evaluation factors and subfactors that must be considered in the evaluation of phase-one proposals.
The agency evaluates phase-one proposals on the basis of the phase-one evaluation factors set forth in the solicitation.

(4) The contracting officer selects as the most highly qualified the number of offerors specified in the solicitation to provide the property or services under the contract and requests the selected offerors to submit phase-two competitive proposals that include technical proposals and cost or price information.
Each solicitation establishes with respect to phase two—

(A) the technical submission for the proposal, including design concepts or proposed solutions to requirements addressed within the scope of work (or both), and

(B) the evaluation factors and subfactors, including cost or price, that must be considered in the evaluations of proposals in accordance with subsections (b), (c), and (d) of section 253a of this title.

The contracting officer separately evaluates the submissions described in subparagraphs (A) and (B).

(5) The agency awards the contract in accordance with section 253b of this title.

(d) Solicitation to state number of offerors to be selected for phase-two requests for competitive proposals

A solicitation issued pursuant to the procedures described in subsection (c) of this section shall state the maximum number of offerors that are to be selected to submit competitive proposals pursuant to subsection (c)(4) of this section.
The maximum number specified in the solicitation shall not exceed 5 unless the agency determines with respect to an individual solicitation that a specified number greater than 5 is in the Government's interest and is consistent with the purposes and objectives of the two-phase selection process.

(e) Requirement for guidance and regulations

The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall include guidance—

(1) regarding the factors that may be considered in determining whether the two-phase contracting procedures authorized by subsection (a) of this section are appropriate for use in individual contracting situations;

(2) regarding the factors that may be used in selecting contractors; and

(3) providing for a uniform approach to be used Government-wide.

§254. Contract requirements

(a) Contracts awarded using procedures other than sealed-bid procedures

Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, contracts awarded after using procedures other than sealed-bid procedures may be of any type which in the opinion of the agency head will promote the best interests of the Government.
Every contract awarded after using procedures other than sealed-bid procedures shall contain a suitable warranty, as determined by the agency head, by the contractor that no person or selling agency has been employed or retained to solicit or secure such contract upon an agreement or understanding for a commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent fee, excepting bona fide employees or bona fide established commercial or selling agencies maintained by the contractor for the purpose of securing business, for the breach or violation of which warranty the Government shall have the right to annul such contract without liability or in its discretion to deduct from the contract price or consideration the full amount of such commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent fee.
The preceding sentence does not apply to a contract for an amount that is not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold or to a contract for the acquisition of commercial items.

(b) Barred contracts; fee limitation; determination of use; advance notification

The cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost system of contracting shall not be used, and in the case of a cost-plus-a-fixed-fee contract the fee shall not exceed 10 percent of the estimated cost of the contract, exclusive of the fee, as determined by the agency head at the time of entering into such contract (except that a fee not in excess of 15 percent of such estimated cost is authorized in any such contract for experimental, developmental, or research work and that a fee inclusive of the contractor's costs and not in excess of 6 percent of the estimated cost, exclusive of fees, as determined by the agency head at the time of entering into the contract, of the project to which such fee is applicable is authorized in contracts for architectural or engineering services relating to any public works or utility project). All cost and cost-plus-a-fixed-fee contracts shall provide for advance notification by the contractor to the procuring agency of any subcontract thereunder on a cost-plus-a-fixed-fee basis and of any fixed-price subcontract or purchase order which exceeds in dollar amount either the simplified acquisition threshold or 5 percent of the total estimated cost of the prime contract; and a procuring agency, through any authorized representative thereof, shall have the right to inspect the plans and to audit the books and records of any prime contractor or subcontractor engaged in the performance of a cost or cost-plus-a-fixed-fee contract.

Ex. Ord.
No. 13201, Feb. 17, 2001, 66 F.R. 11221, provided:

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. 471 et seq. [now chapters 1 to 11 of Title 40, Public Buildings, Property, and Works, and title III of the Act of June 30, 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251 et seq.)], and in order to ensure the economical and efficient administration and completion of Government contracts, it is hereby ordered that:

Section 1. (a) This order is designed to promote economy and efficiency in Government procurement.
When workers are better informed of their rights, including their rights under the Federal labor laws, their productivity is enhanced.
The availability of such a workforce from which the United States may draw facilitates the efficient and economical completion of its procurement contracts.

(b) The Secretary of Labor (Secretary) shall be responsible for the administration and enforcement of this order.
The Secretary shall adopt such rules and regulations and issue such orders as are deemed necessary and appropriate to achieve the purposes of this order.

Sec. 2. (a) Except in contracts exempted in accordance with section 3 of this order, all Government contracting departments and agencies shall, to the extent consistent with law, include the following provisions in every Government contract, other than collective bargaining agreements as defined in 5 U.S.C. 7103(a)(8) and purchases under the “Simplified Acquisition Threshold” as defined in the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 403).

“1. During the term of this contract, the contractor agrees to post a notice, of such size and in such form as the Secretary of Labor shall prescribe, in conspicuous places in and about its plants and offices, including all places where notices to employees are customarily posted.
The notice shall include the following information (except that the last sentence shall not be included in notices posted in the plants or offices of carriers subject to the Railway Labor Act, as amended (45 U.S.C. 151-188)):

“NOTICE TO EMPLOYEES

Under Federal law, employees cannot be required to join a union or maintain membership in a union in order to retain their jobs.
Under certain conditions, the law permits a union and an employer to enter into a union-security agreement requiring employees to pay uniform periodic dues and initiation fees.
However, employees who are not union members can object to the use of their payments for certain purposes and can only be required to pay their share of union costs relating to collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment.

“If you do not want to pay that portion of dues or fees used to support activities not related to collective bargaining, contract administration, or grievance adjustment, you are entitled to an appropriate reduction in your payment.
If you believe that you have been required to pay dues or fees used in part to support activities not related to collective bargaining, contract administration, or grievance adjustment, you may be entitled to a refund and to an appropriate reduction in future payments.

“For further information concerning your rights, you may wish to contact the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) either at one of its Regional offices or at the following address:

National Labor Relations Board

Division of Information

“2. The contractor will comply with all provisions of Executive Order 13201 of February 17, 2001, and related rules, regulations, and orders of the Secretary of Labor.

“3. In the event that the contractor does not comply with any of the requirements set forth in paragraphs (1) or (2) above, this contract may be cancelled, terminated, or suspended in whole or in part, and the contractor may be declared ineligible for further Government contracts in accordance with procedures authorized in or adopted pursuant to Executive Order 13201 of February 17, 2001. Such other sanctions or remedies may be imposed as are provided in Executive Order 13201 of February 17, 2001, or by rule, regulation, or order of the Secretary of Labor, or as are otherwise provided by law.

“4. The contractor will include the provisions of paragraphs (1) through (3) herein in every subcontract or purchase order entered into in connection with this contract unless exempted by rules, regulations, or orders of the Secretary of Labor issued pursuant to section 3 of Executive Order 13201 of February 17, 2001, so that such provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor or vendor.
The contractor will take such action with respect to any such subcontract or purchase order as may be directed by the Secretary of Labor as a means of enforcing such provisions, including the imposition of sanctions for non compliance: Provided, however, that if the contractor becomes involved in litigation with a subcontractor or vendor, or is threatened with such involvement, as a result of such direction, the contractor may request the United States to enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States.”

(b) Whenever, through Acts of Congress or through clarification of existing law by the courts or otherwise, it appears that contractual provisions other than, or in addition to, those set out in subsection (a) of this section are needed to inform employees fully and accurately of their rights with respect to union dues, union-security agreements, or the like, the Secretary shall promptly issue such rules, regulations, or orders as are needed to cause the substitution or addition of appropriate contractual provisions in Government contracts thereafter entered into.

Sec. 3. (a) The Secretary may, if the Secretary finds that special circumstances require an exemption in order to serve the national interest, exempt a contracting department or agency from the requirements of any or all of the provisions of section 2 of this order with respect to a particular contract, subcontract, or purchase order.

(b) The Secretary may, by rule, regulation, or order, exempt from the provisions of section 2 of this order certain classes of contracts to the extent that they involve (i) work outside the United States and do not involve the recruitment or employment of workers within the United States; (ii) work in jurisdictions where State law forbids enforcement of union-security agreements; (iii) work at sites where the notice to employees described in section 2(a) of this order would be unnecessary because the employees are not represented by a union; (iv) numbers of workers below appropriate thresholds set by the Secretary; or (v) subcontracts below an appropriate tier set by the Secretary.

(c) The Secretary may provide, by rule, regulation, or order, for the exemption of facilities of a contractor, subcontractor, or vendor that are in all respects separate and distinct from activities related to the performance of the contract: Provided, that such exemption will not interfere with or impede the effectuation of the purposes of this order: And provided further, that in the absence of such an exemption all facilities shall be covered by the provisions of this order.

Sec. 4. (a) The Secretary may investigate any Government contractor, subcontractor, or vendor to determine whether the contractual provisions required by section 2 of this order have been violated.
Such investigations shall be conducted in accordance with procedures established by the Secretary.

(b) The Secretary shall receive and investigate complaints by employees of a Government contractor, subcontractor, or vendor where such complaints allege a failure to perform or a violation of the contractual provisions required by section 2 of this order.

Sec. 5. (a) The Secretary, or any agency or officer in the executive branch of the Government designated by rule, regulation, or order of the Secretary, may hold such hearings, public or private, regarding compliance with this order as the Secretary may deem advisable.

(b) The Secretary may hold hearings, or cause hearings to be held, in accordance with subsection (a) of this section prior to imposing, ordering, or recommending the imposition of sanctions under this order.
Neither an order for debarment of any contractor from further Government contracts under section 6(b) of this order nor the inclusion of a contractor on a published list of noncomplying contractors under section 6(c) of this order shall be carried out without affording the contractor an opportunity for a hearing.

Sec. 6. In accordance with such rules, regulations, or orders as the Secretary may issue or adopt, the Secretary may:

(a) after consulting with the contracting department or agency, direct that department or agency to cancel, terminate, suspend, or cause to be cancelled, terminated, or suspended, any contract, or any portion or portions thereof, for failure of the contractor to comply with the contractual provisions required by section 2 of this order; contracts may be cancelled, terminated, or suspended absolutely, or continuance of contracts may be conditioned upon future compliance: Provided, that before issuing a directive under this subsection, the Secretary shall provide the head of the contracting department or agency an opportunity to offer written objections to the issuance of such a directive, which objections shall include a complete statement of reasons for the objections, among which reasons shall be a finding that completion of the contract is essential to the agency's mission: And provided further, that no directive shall be issued by the Secretary under this subsection so long as the head of the contracting department or agency continues personally to object to the issuance of such directive;

(b) after consulting with each affected contracting department or agency, provide that one or more contracting departments or agencies shall refrain from entering into further contracts, or extensions or other modifications of existing contracts, with any noncomplying contractor, until such contractor has satisfied the Secretary that such contractor has complied with and will carry out the provisions of this order: Provided, that before issuing a directive under this subsection, the Secretary shall provide the head of each contracting department or agency an opportunity to offer written objections to the issuance of such a directive, which objections shall include a complete statement of reasons for the objections, among which reasons shall be a finding that further contracts or extensions or other modifications of existing contracts with the noncomplying contractor are essential to the agency's mission: And provided further, that no directive shall be issued by the Secretary under this subsection so long as the head of a contracting department or agency continues personally to object to the issuance of such directive; and

(c) publish, or cause to be published, the names of contractors that have, in the judgment of the Secretary, failed to comply with the provisions of this order or of related rules, regulations, and orders of the Secretary.

Sec. 7. Whenever the Secretary invokes section 6(a) or 6(b) of this order, the contracting department or agency shall report the results of the action it has taken to the Secretary within such time as the Secretary shall specify.

Sec. 8. Each contracting department and agency shall cooperate with the Secretary and provide such information and assistance as the Secretary may require in the performance of the Secretary's functions under this order.

Sec. 9. The Secretary may delegate any function or duty of the Secretary under this order to any officer in the Department of Labor or to any other officer in the executive branch of the Government, with the consent of the head of the department or agency in which that officer serves.

Sec. 10. The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR Council) shall take whatever action is required to implement in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) the provisions of this order and of any related rules, regulations, or orders of the Secretary that were issued to implement this Executive Order.
The FAR Council shall amend the FAR to require each solicitation of offers for a contract to include a provision that implements section 2 of this order.

Sec. 11. As it relates to notification of employee rights concerning payment of union dues or fees, Executive Order 12836 of February 1, 1993, which, among other things, revoked Executive Order 12800 of April 13, 1992, is revoked.

Sec. 12. The heads of executive departments and agencies shall revoke expeditiously any orders, rules, regulations, guidelines, or policies implementing or enforcing Executive Order 12836 of February 1, 1993, as it relates to notification of employee rights concerning payment of union dues or fees, to the extent consistent with law.

Sec. 13. This order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and is not intended to, nor does it, create any right to administrative or judicial review, or any right, whether substantive or procedural, enforceable by any party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.

Sec. 14. The provisions of this order shall apply to contracts resulting from solicitations issued on or after the effective date of this order.

Sec. 15. This order shall become effective 60 days after the date of this order.

(3) Cost or pricing data required to be submitted under paragraph (1) (or under subsection (c) of this section), and a certification required to be submitted under paragraph (2), shall be submitted—

(A) in the case of a submission by a prime contractor (or an offeror for a prime contract), to the contracting officer for the contract (or to a designated representative of the contracting officer); or

(B) in the case of a submission by a subcontractor (or an offeror for a subcontract), to the prime contractor.

(4) Except as provided under subsection (b) of this section, this section applies to contracts entered into by the head of an executive agency on behalf of a foreign government.

(5) A waiver of requirements for submission of certified cost or pricing data that is granted under subsection (b)(1)(C) of this section in the case of a contract or subcontract does not waive the requirement under paragraph (1)(C) for submission of cost or pricing data in the case of subcontracts under that contract or subcontract unless the head of the procuring activity granting the waiver determines that the requirement under that paragraph should be waived in the case of such subcontracts and justifies in writing the reasons for the determination.

(b) Exceptions

(1) In general

Submission of certified cost or pricing data shall not be required under subsection (a) of this section in the case of a contract, a subcontract, or a modification of a contract or subcontract—

(A) for which the price agreed upon is based on—

(i) adequate price competition; or

(ii) prices set by law or regulation;

(B) for the acquisition of a commercial item; or

(C) in an exceptional case when the head of the procuring activity, without delegation, determines that the requirements of this section may be waived and justifies in writing the reasons for such determination.

(2) Modifications of contracts and subcontracts for commercial items

In the case of a modification of a contract or subcontract for a commercial item that is not covered by the exception to the submission of certified cost or pricing data in paragraph (1)(A) or (1)(B), submission of certified cost or pricing data shall not be required under subsection (a) of this section if—

(A) the contract or subcontract being modified is a contract or subcontract for which submission of certified cost or pricing data may not be required by reason of paragraph (1)(A) or (1)(B); and

(B) the modification would not change the contract or subcontract, as the case may be, from a contract or subcontract for the acquisition of a commercial item to a contract or subcontract for the acquisition of an item other than a commercial item.

(c) Cost or pricing data on below-threshold contracts

(1) Authority to require submission

Subject to paragraph (2), when certified cost or pricing data are not required to be submitted by subsection (a) of this section for a contract, subcontract, or modification of a contract or subcontract, such data may nevertheless be required to be submitted by the head of the procuring activity, but only if the head of the procuring activity determines that such data are necessary for the evaluation by the agency of the reasonableness of the price of the contract, subcontract, or modification of a contract or subcontract.
In any case in which the head of the procuring activity requires such data to be submitted under this subsection, the head of the procuring activity shall justify in writing the reason for such requirement.

(2) Exception

The head of the procuring activity may not require certified cost or pricing data to be submitted under this paragraph for any contract or subcontract, or modification of a contract or subcontract, covered by the exceptions in subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection (b)(1) of this section.

(3) Delegation of authority prohibited

The head of a procuring activity may not delegate the functions under this paragraph.

(d) Submission of other information

(1) Authority to require submission

When certified cost or pricing data are not required to be submitted under this section for a contract, subcontract, or modification of a contract or subcontract, the contracting officer shall require submission of data other than certified cost or pricing data to the extent necessary to determine the reasonableness of the price of the contract, subcontract, or modification of the contract or subcontract.
Except in the case of a contract or subcontract covered by the exceptions in subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section, the contracting officer shall require that the data submitted include, at a minimum, appropriate information on the prices at which the same item or similar items have previously been sold that is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price for the procurement.

(2) Limitations on authority

The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall include the following provisions regarding the types of information that contracting officers may require under paragraph (1):

(A) Reasonable limitations on requests for sales data relating to commercial items.

(B) A requirement that a contracting officer limit, to the maximum extent practicable, the scope of any request for information relating to commercial items from an offeror to only that information that is in the form regularly maintained by the offeror in commercial operations.

(C) A statement that any information received relating to commercial items that is exempt from disclosure under section 552(b) of title 5 shall not be disclosed by the Federal Government.

(e) Price reductions for defective cost or pricing data

(1)(A) A prime contract (or change or modification to a prime contract) under which a certificate under subsection (a)(2) of this section is required shall contain a provision that the price of the contract to the United States, including profit or fee, shall be adjusted to exclude any significant amount by which it may be determined by the head of the executive agency that such price was increased because the contractor (or any subcontractor required to make available such a certificate) submitted defective cost or pricing data.

(B) For the purposes of this section, defective cost or pricing data are cost or pricing data which, as of the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or another date agreed upon between the parties), were inaccurate, incomplete, or noncurrent.
If for purposes of the preceding sentence the parties agree upon a date other than the date of agreement on the price of the contract, the date agreed upon by the parties shall be as close to the date of agreement on the price of the contract as is practicable.

(2) In determining for purposes of a contract price adjustment under a contract provision required by paragraph (1) whether, and to what extent, a contract price was increased because the contractor (or a subcontractor) submitted defective cost or pricing data, it shall be a defense that the United States did not rely on the defective data submitted by the contractor or subcontractor.

(3) It is not a defense to an adjustment of the price of a contract under a contract provision required by paragraph (1) that—

(A) the price of the contract would not have been modified even if accurate, complete, and current cost or pricing data had been submitted by the contractor or subcontractor because the contractor or subcontractor—

(i) was the sole source of the property or services procured; or

(ii) otherwise was in a superior bargaining position with respect to the property or services procured;

(B) the contracting officer should have known that the cost or pricing data in issue were defective even though the contractor or subcontractor took no affirmative action to bring the character of the data to the attention of the contracting officer;

(C) the contract was based on an agreement between the contractor and the United States about the total cost of the contract and there was no agreement about the cost of each item procured under such contract; or

(D) the prime contractor or subcontractor did not submit a certification of cost or pricing data relating to the contract as required under subsection (a)(2) of this section.

(4)(A) A contractor shall be allowed to offset an amount against the amount of a contract price adjustment under a contract provision required by paragraph (1) if—

(i) the contractor certifies to the contracting officer (or to a designated representative of the contracting officer) that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, the contractor is entitled to the offset; and

(ii) the contractor proves that the cost or pricing data were available before the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or price of the modification), or, if applicable consistent with paragraph (1)(B), another date agreed upon between the parties, and that the data were not submitted as specified in subsection (a)(3) of this section before such date.

(B) A contractor shall not be allowed to offset an amount otherwise authorized to be offset under subparagraph (A) if—

(i) the certification under subsection (a)(2) of this section with respect to the cost or pricing data involved was known to be false when signed; or

(ii) the United States proves that, had the cost or pricing data referred to in subparagraph (A)(ii) been submitted to the United States before the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or price of the modification) or, if applicable under paragraph (1)(B), another date agreed upon between the parties, the submission of such cost or pricing data would not have resulted in an increase in that price in the amount to be offset.

(f) Interest and penalties for certain overpayments

(1) If the United States makes an overpayment to a contractor under a contract with an executive agency subject to this section and the overpayment was due to the submission by the contractor of defective cost or pricing data, the contractor shall be liable to the United States—

(a) Authority to enter into share-in-savings contracts

(1) The head of an executive agency may enter into a share-in-savings contract for information technology (as defined in section 11101(6) of title 40) in which the Government awards a contract to improve mission-related or administrative processes or to accelerate the achievement of its mission and share with the contractor in savings achieved through contract performance.

(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a share-in-savings contract shall be awarded for a period of not more than five years.

(B) A share-in-savings contract may be awarded for a period greater than five years, but not more than 10 years, if the head of the agency determines in writing prior to award of the contract that—

(i) the level of risk to be assumed and the investment to be undertaken by the contractor is likely to inhibit the government from obtaining the needed information technology competitively at a fair and reasonable price if the contract is limited in duration to a period of five years or less; and

(ii) usage of the information technology to be acquired is likely to continue for a period of time sufficient to generate reasonable benefit for the government.

(3) Contracts awarded pursuant to the authority of this section shall, to the maximum extent practicable, be performance-based contracts that identify objective outcomes and contain performance standards that will be used to measure achievement and milestones that must be met before payment is made.

(4) Contracts awarded pursuant to the authority of this section shall include a provision containing a quantifiable baseline that is to be the basis upon which a savings share ratio is established that governs the amount of payment a contractor is to receive under the contract.
Before commencement of performance of such a contract, the senior procurement executive of the agency shall determine in writing that the terms of the provision are quantifiable and will likely yield value to the Government.

(5)(A) The head of the agency may retain savings realized through the use of a share-in-savings contract under this section that are in excess of the total amount of savings paid to the contractor under the contract, but may not retain any portion of such savings that is attributable to a decrease in the number of civilian employees of the Federal Government performing the function.
Except as provided in subparagraph (B), savings shall be credited to the appropriation or fund against which charges were made to carry out the contract and shall be used for information technology.

(B) Amounts retained by the agency under this subsection shall—

(i) without further appropriation, remain available until expended; and

(ii) be applied first to fund any contingent liabilities associated with share-in-savings procurements that are not fully funded.

(b) Cancellation and termination

(1) If funds are not made available for the continuation of a share-in-savings contract entered into under this section in a subsequent fiscal year, the contract shall be canceled or terminated.
The costs of cancellation or termination may be paid out of—

(A) appropriations available for the performance of the contract;

(B) appropriations available for acquisition of the information technology procured under the contract, and not otherwise obligated; or

(C) funds subsequently appropriated for payments of costs of cancellation or termination, subject to the limitations in paragraph (3).

(2) The amount payable in the event of cancellation or termination of a share-in-savings contract shall be negotiated with the contractor at the time the contract is entered into.

(3)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), the head of an executive agency may enter into share-in-savings contracts under this section in any given fiscal year even if funds are not made specifically available for the full costs of cancellation or termination of the contract if funds are available and sufficient to make payments with respect to the first fiscal year of the contract and the following conditions are met regarding the funding of cancellation and termination liability:

(i) The amount of unfunded contingent liability for the contract does not exceed the lesser of—

(I) 25 percent of the estimated costs of a cancellation or termination; or

(II) $5,000,000.

(ii) Unfunded contingent liability in excess of $1,000,000 has been approved by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget or the Director's designee.

(B) The aggregate number of share-in-savings contracts that may be entered into under subparagraph (A) by all executive agencies to which this subchapter 1 applies in a fiscal year may not exceed 5 in each of fiscal years 2003, 2004, and 2005.

(1) A provision specifying the minimum monetary wages to be paid the various classes of service employees in the performance of the contract or any subcontract thereunder, as determined by the Secretary, or his authorized representative, in accordance with prevailing rates for such employees in the locality, or, where a collective-bargaining agreement covers any such service employees, in accordance with the rates for such employees provided for in such agreement, including prospective wage increases provided for in such agreement as a result of arm's length negotiations.
In no case shall such wages be lower than the minimum specified in subsection (b) of this section.

(2) A provision specifying the fringe benefits to be furnished in the various classes of service employees, engaged in the performance of the contract or any subcontract thereunder, as determined by the Secretary or his authorized representative to be prevailing for such employees in the locality, or, where a collective-bargaining agreement covers any such service employees, to be provided for in such agreement, including prospective fringe benefits increases provided for in such agreement as a result of arm's-length negotiations.

(3) A provision that no part of the services covered by this chapter will be performed in buildings or surroundings or under working conditions, provided by or under the control or supervision of the contractor or any subcontractor, which are unsanitary or hazardous or dangerous to the health or safety of service employees engaged to furnish the services.

Any violation of any of the contract stipulations required by section 351(a)(1) or (2) or of section 351(b) of this title shall render the party responsible therefor liable for a sum equal to the amount of any deductions, rebates, refunds, or underpayment of compensation due to any employee engaged in the performance of such contract.
So much of the accrued payment due on the contract or any other contract between the same contractor and the Federal Government may be withheld as is necessary to pay such employees.
Such withheld sums shall be held in a deposit fund.

(b) Limitations and regulations allowing variations, tolerances, and exemptions

The Secretary may provide such reasonable limitations and may make such rules and regulations allowing reasonable variation, tolerances, and exemptions to and from any or all provisions of this chapter (other than section 358 of this title), but only in special circumstances where he determines that such limitation, variation, tolerance, or exemption is necessary and proper in the public interest or to avoid the serious impairment of government business, and is in accord with the remedial purpose of this chapter to protect prevailing labor standards.

(c) Predecessor contracts; employees’ wages and fringe benefits

No contractor or subcontractor under a contract, which succeeds a contract subject to this chapter and under which substantially the same services are furnished, shall pay any service employee under such contract less than the wages and fringe benefits, including accrued wages and fringe benefits, and any prospective increases in wages and fringe benefits provided for in a collective-bargaining agreement as a result of arm's-length negotiations, to which such service employees would have been entitled if they were employed under the predecessor contract: Provided, That in any of the foregoing circumstances such obligations shall not apply if the Secretary finds after a hearing in accordance with regulations adopted by the Secretary that such wages and fringe benefits are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality.

(d) Duration of contract

Subject to limitations in annual appropriation Acts but notwithstanding any other provision of law, contracts to which this chapter applies may, if authorized by the Secretary, be for any term of years not exceeding five, if each such contract provides for the periodic adjustment of wages and fringe benefits pursuant to future determinations, issued in the manner prescribed in section 351 of this title no less often than once every two years during the term of the contract, covering the various classes of service employees.

(Pub. L. 89–286, §4, Oct. 22, 1965, 79 Stat. 1035; Pub. L. 92–473, §3, Oct. 9, 1972, 86 Stat. 789.)

(a) The Comptroller General is directed to distribute a list to all agencies of the Government giving the names of persons or firms that the Federal agencies or the Secretary have found to have violated this chapter.
Unless the Secretary otherwise recommends because of unusual circumstances, no contract of the United States shall be awarded to the persons or firms appearing on this list or to any firm, corporation, partnership, or association in which such persons or firms have a substantial interest until three years have elapsed from the date of publication of the list containing the name of such persons or firms.
Where the Secretary does not otherwise recommend because of unusual circumstances, he shall, not later than ninety days after a hearing examiner has made a finding of a violation of this chapter, forward to the Comptroller General the name of the individual or firm found to have violated the provisions of this chapter.

(b) If the accrued payments withheld under the terms of the contract are insufficient to reimburse all service employees with respect to whom there has been a failure to pay the compensation required pursuant to this chapter, the United States may bring action against the contractor, subcontractor, or any sureties in any court of competent jurisdiction to recover the remaining amount of underpayments.
Any sums thus recovered by the United States shall be held in the deposit fund and shall be paid, on order of the Secretary, directly to the underpaid employee or employees.
Any sum not paid to an employee because of inability to do so within three years shall be covered into the Treasury of the United States as miscellaneous receipts.

Streamlining Procurement Through Electronic Commerce

Memorandum of President of the United States, Oct. 28, 1993, 58 F.R. 58095, provided:

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies [and] the President's Management Council

The Federal Government spends $200 billion annually buying goods and services.
Unfortunately, the red tape and burdensome paperwork of the current procurement system increases costs, produces unnecessary delays, and reduces Federal work force productivity.
Moving to an electronic commerce system to simplify and streamline the purchasing process will promote customer service and cost-effectiveness.
The electronic exchange of acquisition information between the private sector and the Federal Government also will increase competition by improving access to Federal contracting opportunities for the more than 300,000 vendors currently doing business with the Government, particularly small businesses, as well as many other vendors who find access to bidding opportunities difficult under the current system.
For these reasons, I am committed to fundamentally altering and improving the way the Federal Government buys goods and services by ensuring that electronic commerce is implemented for appropriate Federal purchases as quickly as possible.

1. OBJECTIVES.

The objectives of this electronic commerce initiative are to:

(a) exchange procurement information—such as solicitations, offers, contracts, purchase orders, invoices, payments, and other contractual documents—electronically between the private sector and the Federal Government to the maximum extent practical;

(b) provide businesses, including small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned businesses, with greater access to Federal procurement opportunities;

(c) ensure that potential suppliers are provided simplified access to the Federal Government's electronic commerce system;

(d) employ nationally and internationally recognized data formats that serve to broaden and ease the electronic interchange of data; and

(e) use agency and industry systems and networks to enable the Government and potential suppliers to exchange information and access Federal procurement data.

2. IMPLEMENTATION.

The President's Management Council, in coordination with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy of the Office of Management and Budget, and in consultation with appropriate Federal agencies with applicable technical and functional expertise, as necessary, shall provide overall leadership, management oversight, and policy direction to implement electronic commerce in the executive branch through the following actions:

(a) by March 1994, define the architecture for the Government-wide electronic commerce acquisition system and identify executive departments or agencies responsible for developing, implementing, operating, and maintaining the Federal electronic system;

(b) by September 1994, establish an initial electronic commerce capability to enable the Federal Government and private vendors to electronically exchange standardized requests for quotations, quotes, purchase orders, and notice of awards and begin Government-wide implementation;

(c) by July 1995, implement a full scale Federal electronic commerce system that expands initial capabilities to include electronic payments, document interchange, and supporting databases; and

(d) by January 1997, complete Government-wide implementation of electronic commerce for appropriate Federal purchases, to the maximum extent possible.

This implementation schedule should be accelerated where practicable.

The head of each executive department or agency shall:

(a) ensure that budgetary resources are available, within approved budget levels, for electronic commerce implementation in each respective department or agency;

(b) assist the President's Management Council in implementing the electronic commerce system as quickly as possible in accordance with the schedules established herein; and

(c) designate one or more senior level employees to assist the President's Management Council and serve as a point of contact for the development and implementation of the Federal electronic commerce system within each respective department or agency.

3. NO PRIVATE RIGHTS CREATED.

This directive is for the internal management of the executive branch and does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.

The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

William J. Clinton.

(B) agree to a contract price adjustment, with interest, for any increased costs paid to such contractor or subcontractor by the United States by reason of a change in the contractor's or subcontractor's cost accounting practices or by reason of a failure by the contractor or subcontractor to comply with applicable cost accounting standards.

(2) If the United States and a contractor or subcontractor fail to agree on a contract price adjustment, including whether the contractor or subcontractor has complied with the applicable cost accounting standards, the disagreement will constitute a dispute under the Contract Disputes Act [41 U.S.C. 601 et seq.].

(3) Any contract price adjustment undertaken pursuant to paragraph (1)(B) shall be made, where applicable, on relevant contracts between the United States and the contractor that are subject to the cost accounting standards so as to protect the United States from payment, in the aggregate, of increased costs (as defined by the Board). In no case shall the Government recover costs greater than the increased cost (as defined by the Board) to the Government, in the aggregate, on the relevant contracts subject to the price adjustment, unless the contractor made a change in its cost accounting practices of which it was aware or should have been aware at the time of the price negotiation and which it failed to disclose to the Government.

(4) The interest rate applicable to any contract price adjustment shall be the annual rate of interest established under section 6621 of title 26 for such period.

(3) The Administrator, under the authority set forth in section 405 of this title, shall ensure that no regulation or proposed regulation of an executive agency is inconsistent with a cost accounting standard promulgated or amended under this section by rescinding or denying the promulgation of any such inconsistent regulation or proposed regulation and taking such other action authorized under section 405 of this title as may be appropriate.

(4) Costs which are the subject of cost accounting standards promulgated under this section shall not be subject to regulations that are established by another executive agency that differ from such standards with respect to the measurement, assignment, and allocation of such costs.

(k) Examinations

For the purpose of determining whether a contractor or subcontractor has complied with cost accounting standards promulgated under this section and has followed consistently the contractor's or subcontractor's disclosed cost accounting practices, any authorized representative of the head of the agency concerned, of the offices of inspector general established pursuant to the Inspector General Act of 1978, or of the Comptroller General of the United States shall have the right to examine and make copies of any documents, papers, or records of such contractor or subcontractor relating to compliance with such cost accounting standards.

Each claim by a contractor against the government relating to a contract and each claim by the government against a contractor relating to a contract shall be submitted within 6 years after the accrual of the claim.
The preceding sentence does not apply to a claim by the government against a contractor that is based on a claim by the contractor involving fraud.
The contracting officer shall issue his decisions in writing, and shall mail or otherwise furnish a copy of the decision to the contractor.
The decision shall state the reasons for the decision reached, and shall inform the contractor of his rights as provided in this chapter.

Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit executive agencies from including a clause in government contracts requiring that pending final decision of an appeal, action, or final settlement, a contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of the contract in accordance with the contracting officer's decision.

(c) Amount of claim; certification; notification; time of issuance; presumption

(1) A contracting officer shall issue a decision on any submitted claim of $100,000 or less within sixty days from his receipt of a written request from the contractor that a decision be rendered within that period.
For claims of more than $100,000, the contractor shall certify that the claim is made in good faith, that the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of his knowledge and belief, that the amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the contractor believes the government is liable, and that the certifier is duly authorized to certify the claim on behalf of the contractor.

(2) A contracting officer shall, within sixty days of receipt of a submitted certified claim over $100,000—

(A) issue a decision; or

(5) Any failure by the contracting officer to issue a decision on a contract claim within the period required will be deemed to be a decision by the contracting officer denying the claim and will authorize the commencement of the appeal or suit on the claim as otherwise provided in this chapter.
However, in the event an appeal or suit is so commenced in the absence of a prior decision by the contracting officer, the tribunal concerned may, at its option, stay the proceedings to obtain a decision on the claim by the contracting officer.

(6) The contracting officer shall have no obligation to render a final decision on any claim of more than $100,000 that is not certified in accordance with paragraph (1) if, within 60 days after receipt of the claim, the contracting officer notifies the contractor in writing of the reasons why any attempted certification was found to be defective.
A defect in the certification of a claim shall not deprive a court or an agency board of contract appeals of jurisdiction over that claim.
Prior to the entry of a final judgment by a court or a decision by an agency board of contract appeals, the court or agency board shall require a defective certification to be corrected.

(7) The certification required by paragraph (1) may be executed by any person duly authorized to bind the contractor with respect to the claim.

In any case in which a contractor rejects a request of an agency for alternative dispute resolution proceedings, the contractor shall inform the agency in writing of the contractor's specific reasons for rejecting the request.
