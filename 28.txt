Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C. 1940 ed., §211, and section 864 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions (Apr. 12, 1900, ch. 191, §35, 31 Stat. 85; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §116, 36 Stat. 1131; Jan. 28, 1915, ch. 22, §§1, 2, 38 Stat. 803; Mar. 2, 1917, ch. 145, §42, 39 Stat. 966; Feb. 13, 1925, ch. 229, §§1, 13, 43 Stat. 936, 942; Jan. 31, 1928, ch. 14, §1, 45 Stat. 54; Feb. 28, 1929, ch. 363, §1, 45 Stat. 1346; May 17, 1932, ch. 190, 47 Stat. 158).

Form of section was simplified.

The District of Columbia was added as a separate circuit.
This is in accord with the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States which held the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to be a circuit court of appeals within the Transfer Act of Sept. 14, 1922, ch. 305, 42 Stat. 837, incorporated in the Judicial Code as §238(a), but repealed by act Feb. 13, 1925, ch. 229, §13, 43 Stat. 942. (See Swift and Co. v. U.S., 1928, 48 S.Ct. 311, 276 U.S. 311, 72 L.Ed. 587.)

In recognizing the District of Columbia as a separate circuit, the Supreme Court recently used this language: “* * * the eleven circuits forming the single federal judicature * * *”. Comm'r. v. Bedford's Estate, 65 S.Ct. 1157, at page 1160, 325 U.S. 283, 89 L.Ed. 611.

See section 17 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., providing, “For the purposes of sections 17–23 of this title, the District of Columbia shall be deemed to be a judicial circuit * * *”, and act Dec. 23, 1944, ch. 724, 58 Stat. 925, which amended section 215 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., incorporated in section 42 of this title.
Such amendment provided that for the purposes of said section 215 “the District of Columbia shall be deemed to be a judicial circuit.”

Many other acts of Congress have recognized the District of Columbia as a separate circuit. (See the following acts; Aug. 24, 1937, ch. 754, 50 Stat. 751; Feb. 11, 1938, ch. 25, 52 Stat. 28; Aug. 5, 1939, ch. 433, 53 Stat. 1204; Aug. 7, 1939, ch. 501, 53 Stat. 1223; Dec. 29, 1942, ch. 835, 56 Stat. 1094; May 11, 1944, ch. 192, 58 Stat. 218; Dec. 23, 1944, ch. 724, 58 Stat. 925.)

See also the following acts recognizing the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia as a circuit court of appeals: Aug. 15, 1921, ch. 64, 42 Stat. 162; July 5, 1935, ch. 372, 49 Stat. 454; Aug. 24, 1937, ch. 754, 50 Stat. 751; Apr. 6, 1942, ch. 210, 56 Stat. 198; May 9, 1942, ch. 295, 56 Stat. 271. See also Rule 81(d) Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

In the following cases the Supreme Court of the United States has recognized the status of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia as a permanent establishment within the federal judicial system: O'Donoghue v. United States, 1933, 53 S.Ct. 740, 289 U.S. 516, 77 L.Ed. 1356; Federal Trade Commission v. Klesner, 1927, 47 S.Ct. 557, 274 U.S. 145, 71 L.Ed. 972; Claiborne-Annapolis Ferry v. United States, 1932, 52 S.Ct. 440, 285 U.S. 382, 76 L.Ed. 808; United States v. California Canneries, 1929, 49 S.Ct. 423, 279 U.S. 553, 73 L.Ed. 838.

Alaska, Canal Zone, and Virgin Islands were added to the 9th, 5th, and 3rd Circuits, respectively, to conform to section 1294 of this title.

Some of the provisions of section 864 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., have been retained in said title.
For those which were incorporated in other sections of this revised title, see Distribution Table.

Termination of United States District Court for the District of the Canal Zone

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §215 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §119, 36 Stat. 1131; Dec. 23, 1944, ch. 724, 58 Stat. 925).

The authority of the Chief Justice in vacation to assign a circuit justice to more than one circuit was extended by omitting the phrase “whenever by reason of death or resignation, no Justice is allotted to a circuit.”

The provision in section 215 of Title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that, for the purposes of said section, the “District of Columbia shall be deemed to be a judicial circuit,” was omitted, since the District of Columbia is made a judicial circuit by section 41 of this title.

The last paragraph was added to make clear the intent of Congress that the powers of the Court to assign the justices among the several circuits should be completely flexible.

Changes were made in phraseology.

§43. Creation and composition of courts

(a) There shall be in each circuit a court of appeals, which shall be a court of record, known as the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit.

(b) Each court of appeals shall consist of the circuit judges of the circuit in regular active service.
The circuit justice and justices or judges designated or assigned shall be competent to sit as judges of the court.

(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 870; Nov. 13, 1963, Pub. L. 88–176, §1(a), 77 Stat. 331.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §212 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §117, 36 Stat. 1131).

The provision in section 212 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for a three-judge court of appeals was permissive and did not limit the power of the court to sit in banc.
Thus, subsection (b) reflects present status of law, namely, that court is composed of not only circuit judges of the circuit in active service, of whom there may be more than three, but the circuit justice or justices and judges who may be assigned or designated to the court. (See Textile Mills Securities Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 1942, 62 S.Ct. 272, 314 U.S. 326, 86 L.Ed. 249 and Reviser's Notes under section 46 of this title.)

Words “with appellate jurisdiction, as hereinafter limited and established” were omitted as covered by section 1291 et seq. of this title, conferring appellate jurisdiction on the courts of appeals.

The term “court of appeals” was substituted in this section and throughout this title for the term “circuit court of appeals.”

Provision for a quorum of the court is now covered by section 46(d) of this title.

Change of Name of Court

Section 2(b) of act June 25, 1948, provided in part that each circuit court of appeals should, after Sept. 1, 1948, be known as a United States Court of Appeals, but that the enactment of act June 25, 1948 should in no way entail any loss of rights, interruption of jurisdiction, or prejudice to matters pending in any such courts on Sept. 1, 1948.

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §213, and sections 11–201, 11–202, District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed. (Feb. 9, 1893, ch. 74, §1, 27 Stat. 434; Mar. 3, 1901, ch. 854, §§221, 222, 31 Stat. 1224; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §118, 36 Stat. 1131; Jan. 13, 1912, ch. 9, 37 Stat. 52; Feb. 25, 1919, ch. 29, §2, 40 Stat. 1156; Sept. 14, 1922, ch. 306, §6, 42 Stat. 840; Mar. 3, 1925, ch. 437, 43 Stat. 1116; Dec. 13, 1926, ch. 6, §1, 44 Stat. 919; Feb. 28, 1929, ch. 363, §2, 45 Stat. 1347; Mar. 1, 1929, ch. 413, §§1, 2, 45 Stat. 1414; June 10, 1930, ch. 437, 46 Stat. 538; June 10, 1930, ch. 438, 46 Stat. 538; June 19, 1930, ch. 538, 46 Stat. 785; June 16, 1933, ch. 102, 48 Stat. 310; Aug. 2, 1935, ch. 425, §1, 49 Stat. 508; June 24, 1936, ch. 735, §1, 49 Stat. 1903; Apr. 14, 1937, ch. 80, 50 Stat. 64; May 31, 1938, ch. 290, §§1, 3, 52 Stat. 584, 585; May 24, 1940, ch. 209, §1, 54 Stat. 219; Dec. 14, 1942, ch. 731, 56 Stat. 1050; Dec. 7, 1944, ch. 521, §1, 58 Stat. 796; July 31, 1946, ch. 704, §1, 60 Stat. 716).

This section includes the members of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and designates them as “judges” rather than as “justices”, thus harmonizing it with the provisions of section 41 of this title, which specifically designates the District of Columbia as a judicial circuit of the United States.
In doing so it consolidates sections 11–201, 11–202 of the District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., which provided for one “chief justice” and five associate “justices.”

Act February 9, 1893, established a court of appeals for the District of Columbia to consist of one chief justice and two associate justices whose jurisdiction was almost entirely to review the judgments of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, the name of which was changed in 1936 to the District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia.
Circuit courts were established by the first Judiciary Act of September 24, 1789, §4, and R.S. §608, enacted June 22, 1874. R.S. §605 provided that the words “circuit justice” and “justice of a circuit” should designate the justice of the Supreme Court of the United States allotted to any circuit; that “judge” when applied to any circuit included such justice.

The Judiciary Appropriation Act, 1945, Act June 26, 1944, ch. 277, §202, 58 Stat. 358, provided that as used in that Act, “the term ‘circuit court of appeals’ includes the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia; the term ‘senior circuit judge’ includes the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia; and the term ‘circuit judge’ includes associate justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia; and the term ‘judge’ includes justice.”

Provisions in section 11–202 of the District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., and section 213 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for payment of salaries in monthly installments were omitted, since time of payment is a matter of administrative convenience (20 Comp.
Gen. 834).

The exception in subsection (c) extends to circuit judges in the District of Columbia the effect of the recent decision in U.S. ex rel.
Laughlin v. Eicher, D.C. 1944, 56 F.Supp. 972, holding that residence requirement of section 1 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., did not apply to district judges in the District of Columbia. (See Reviser's Note under section 134 of this title.)

The provision in section 213 of the title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that “it shall be the duty of each circuit judge in each circuit to sit as one of the judges of the circuit court of appeals in that circuit from time to time according to law,” was omitted as unnecessary since the duty to serve is implied by the creation and composition of the court in section 43 of this title.

Last sentence, providing that nothing in section 213 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., should prevent a circuit judge from holding district court as provided by law, was omitted as unnecessary. (See section 291 of this title authorizing assignments to district courts.)

Subsection (b) was added in conformity with the U.S. Constitution, art. 3.

Changes were made in phraseology.

(A) are sixty-four years of age or under;

(B) have served for one year or more as a circuit judge; and

(C) have not served previously as chief judge.

(B) In any case under subparagraph (A) in which there is no circuit judge in regular active service who has served as a circuit judge for one year or more, the circuit judge in regular active service who is senior in commission and who has not served previously as chief judge shall act as the chief judge.

(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the chief judge of the circuit appointed under paragraph (1) shall serve for a term of seven years and shall serve after expiration of such term until another judge is eligible under paragraph (1) to serve as chief judge of the circuit.

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on sections 216 and 216a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §120, 36 Stat. 1132; May 23, 1934, ch. 339, 48 Stat. 796).

Subsection (a), providing for “chief judge,” is new.
Such term is adopted to replace the term “senior circuit judge” in recognition of the great increase in administrative duties of such judge.

Subsection (b) conforms with section 4 of this title relating to precedence of associate justices of the Supreme Court, and consolidates the provisions of the second and third sentences of section 216 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
The designation when filed in the court of appeals will not only record the transfer of function from the relieved chief judge to his successor, but will also determine the question of willingness of the successor to serve.

Other provisions of section 216 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are covered by section 47 of this title.

Subsection (c) is new.

Subsection (d) is based on section 216a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

The official status of the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia holding office on the effective date of the act is preserved by section 2 of the bill to enact revised Title 28.

Changes were made in phraseology.

Savings Provision

Section 203 of part A of title II of Pub. L. 97–164 provided that:

“(a) The amendments to section 45 of title 28, United States Code, and to section 136 of such title, made by sections 201 and 202 of this Act, shall not apply to or affect any person serving as chief judge on the effective date of this Act [Oct. 1, 1982].

“(b) The provisions of section 45(a) of title 28, United States Code, as in effect on the day before the effective date of this Act [Oct. 1, 1982], shall apply to the chief judge of a circuit serving on such effective date.
The provisions of section 136(a) of title 28, United States Code, as in effect on the day before the effective date of this part [Oct. 1, 1982], shall apply to the chief judge of a district court serving on such effective date.”

Appointment of Chief Judge of Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit

Section 166 of Pub. L. 97–164 provided that: “Notwithstanding the provisions of section 45(a) of title 28, United States Code, the first chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit shall be the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Claims or the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, whoever has served longer as chief judge of his court.
Notwithstanding section 45 of title 28, United States Code, whichever of the two chief judges does not become the first chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit under the preceding sentence shall, while in active service, have precedence and be deemed senior in commission over all the circuit judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (other than the first chief judge of that circuit). When the person who first serves as chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacates that position, the position shall be filled in accordance with section 45(a) of title 28, United States Code, as modified by the preceding sentence of this section.”

Chief Judge of Court of Appeals for District of Columbia

Section 2(a) of act June 25, 1948, provided in part that the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in office on Sept. 1, 1948, shall thereafter be known as the Chief Judge.

Section Referred to in Other Sections

This section is referred to in section 372 of this title.

§46. Assignment of judges; panels; hearings; quorum

(a) Circuit judges shall sit on the court and its panels in such order and at such times as the court directs.

(b) In each circuit the court may authorize the hearing and determination of cases and controversies by separate panels, each consisting of three judges, at least a majority of whom shall be judges of that court, unless such judges cannot sit because recused or disqualified, or unless the chief judge of that court certifies that there is an emergency including, but not limited to, the unavailability of a judge of the court because of illness.
Such panels shall sit at the times and places and hear the cases and controversies assigned as the court directs.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit shall determine by rule a procedure for the rotation of judges from panel to panel to ensure that all of the judges sit on a representative cross section of the cases heard and, notwithstanding the first sentence of this subsection, may determine by rule the number of judges, not less than three, who constitute a panel.

(c) Cases and controversies shall be heard and determined by a court or panel of not more than three judges (except that the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit may sit in panels of more than three judges if its rules so provide), unless a hearing or rehearing before the court in banc is ordered by a majority of the circuit judges of the circuit who are in regular active service.
A court in banc shall consist of all circuit judges in regular active service, or such number of judges as may be prescribed in accordance with section 6 of Public Law 95–486 (92 Stat. 1633), except that any senior circuit judge of the circuit shall be eligible to participate, at his election and upon designation and assignment pursuant to section 294(c) of this title and the rules of the circuit, as a member of an in banc court reviewing a decision of a panel of which such judge was a member.

(d) A majority of the number of judges authorized to constitute a court or panel thereof, as provided in paragraph (c), shall constitute a quorum.

(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 871; Nov. 13, 1963, Pub. L. 88–176, §1(b), 77 Stat. 331; Oct. 20, 1978, Pub. L. 95–486, §5(a), (b), 92 Stat. 1633; Apr. 2, 1982, Pub. L. 97–164, title I, §103, title II, §205, 96 Stat. 25, 53.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based in part on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §212 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §117, 36 Stat. 1131).

Subsections (a)–(c) authorize the establishment of divisions of the court and provide for the assignment of circuit judges for hearings and rehearings in banc.

The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that, notwithstanding the three-judge provision of section 212 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., a court of appeals might lawfully consist of a greater number of judges, and that the five active circuit judges of the third circuit might sit in banc for the determination of an appeal. (See Textile Mills Securities Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 1941, 62 S.Ct. 272, 314 U.S. 326, 86 L.Ed. 249.)

The Supreme Court in upholding the unanimous view of the five judges as to their right to sit in banc, notwithstanding the contrary opinion in Langs Estate v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 1938, 97 F.2d 867, said in the Textile Mills case: “There are numerous functions of the court, as a ‘court of record, with appellate jurisdiction’, other than hearing and deciding appeals.
Under the Judicial Code these embrace: prescribing the form of writs and other process and the form and style of its seal (28 U.S.C., §219); the making of rules and regulations (28 U.S.C., §219); the appointment of a clerk (28 U.S.C., §221) and the approval of the appointment and removal of deputy clerks (28 U.S.C., §222); and the fixing of the ‘times’ when court shall be held (28 U.S.C., §223). Furthermore, those various sections of the Judicial Code provide that each of these functions shall be performed by the court.”

This section preserves the interpretation established by the Textile Mills case but provides in subsection (c) that cases shall be heard by a court of not more than three judges unless the court has provided for hearing in banc.
This provision continues the tradition of a three-judge appellate court and makes the decision of a division, the decision of the court, unless rehearing in banc is ordered.
It makes judges available for other assignments, and permits a rotation of judges in such manner as to give to each a maximum of time for the preparation of opinions.

Whether divisions should sit simultaneously at the same or different places in the circuit is a matter for each court to determine.

Survey of Judicial Business in Alaska

Section 23(a) of Pub. L. 86–70, June 25, 1959, 73 Stat. 147, provided that: “The Judicial Conference of the United States, with the assistance of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, shall conduct a study, including a field survey, of the Federal judicial business arising in the State of Alaska with a view toward directing the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to hold such terms of court in Anchorage or such other Alaskan cities as may be necessary for the prompt and efficient administration of justice.”

§49. Assignment of judges to division to appoint independent counsels

(a) Beginning with the two-year period commencing on the date of the enactment of this section, three judges or justices shall be assigned for each successive two-year period to a division of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to be the division of the court for the purpose of appointing independent counsels.
The Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit shall serve as the clerk of such division of the court and shall provide such services as are needed by such division of the court.

(b) Except as provided under subsection (f) of this section, assignment to such division of the court shall not be a bar to other judicial assignments during the term of such division.

(c) In assigning judges or justices to sit on such division of the court, priority shall be given to senior circuit judges and retired justices.

(d) The Chief Justice of the United States shall designate and assign three circuit court judges or justices, one of whom shall be a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, to such division of the court.
Not more than one judge or justice or senior or retired judge or justice may be named to such division from a particular court.

(e) Any vacancy in such division of the court shall be filled only for the remainder of the two-year period in which such vacancy occurs and in the same manner as initial assignments to such division were made.

(f) Except as otherwise provided in chapter 40 of this title, no member of such division of the court who participated in a function conferred on the division under chapter 40 of this title involving an independent counsel shall be eligible to participate in any judicial proceeding concerning a matter which involves such independent counsel while such independent counsel is serving in that office or which involves the exercise of such independent counsel's official duties, regardless of whether such independent counsel is still serving in that office.

Historical and Revision Notes

Sections 81–131 of this chapter show the territorial composition of districts and divisions by counties as of January 1, 1945. All references to dates were omitted as unnecessary.

All references to fixed terms of holding court were also omitted in order to vest in each district court a wider discretion and greater flexibility in the disposition of its business.
Such times will now be determined by rule of court rather than by statute.

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. §142 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §70, 36 Stat. 1105; Feb. 28, 1913, ch. 89, 37 Stat. 698; June 27, 1922, ch. 247, 42 Stat. 667).

Provisions relating to the places for the maintenance of the clerks’ offices were omitted as covered by section 751 of this title, providing that deputy clerks may be designated to reside and maintain offices at such places for holding court as the judge may determine.

Provisions that the offices of the court shall be kept open at all times were omitted as covered by section 452 of this title.

A provision requiring the district judge for the northern district to reside at Birmingham was omitted as incongruous with section 134 of this title, requiring every district judge to reside within the district for which he is appointed.
Likewise the provision of section 142 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., requiring the court to remain in session at Birmingham at least 6 months in each calendar year was omitted as unnecessary and not in harmony with provisions respecting other districts.

The provisions for furnishing rooms and accommodations at Florence, Gadsden, Jasper and Opelika were omitted as obsolete upon advice of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts that Federal accommodations are now available in each of these places.

Changes in arrangement and phraseology were made.

Section 1 of Pub. L. 102–357 provided that: “The Congress makes the following findings:

“(1) The Federal Government has the responsibility to provide quality services which are readily accessible to the people it serves.

“(2) The court facilities in the Central Judicial District of California are presently inadequate, and current and projected growth exacerbates the problem.

“(3) The population demographics of southern California have changed dramatically over the last decade, as the center of population shifts inland.
Between 1980 and 1990, the population of Riverside County increased 76.5 percent, and San Bernardino County's population increased 58.5 percent, to a combined population of 2,600,000.

“(4) In the next 15 years, the population in Riverside and San Bernardino Counties is expected to increase again by 70 percent, and 67 percent, respectively.
By the year 2005, Riverside and San Bernardino Counties will have 4,400,000 residents.

“(5) As a result of the population growth, the freeways connecting the Pacific coast and the inland areas are tremendously overburdened, and Federal offices along the coast are no longer accessible to the residents of Riverside and San Bernardino Counties.

“(6) The creation of 3 divisions in the Central Judicial District of California is urgently needed to provide for the delivery of judicial services to all areas and all residents of the Central Judicial District of California.”

§88. District of Columbia

The District of Columbia constitutes one judicial district.

Court shall be held at Washington.

(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 875.)

Historical and Revision Notes

This section expressly makes the District of Columbia a judicial district of the United States.

Section 41 of this title also makes the District of Columbia a judicial circuit of the United States.

Section 11–305 of the District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., provides that the District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia shall possess the same powers and exercise the same jurisdiction as the district courts of the United States, and shall be deemed a court of the United States.

It is consonant with the ruling of the Supreme Court in O'Donoghue v. United States, 1933, 53 S.Ct. 740, 289 U.S. 516, 77 L.Ed. 1356, that the (then called) Supreme Court and Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia are constitutional courts of the United States, ordained and established under article III of the Constitution, Congress enacted that the Court of Appeals “shall hereafter be known as the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia” (Act of June 7, 1934, 48 Stat. 926); and also changed the name of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia to “district court of the United States for the District of Columbia” (Act of June 25, 1936, 49 Stat. 1921). In Federal Trade Commission v. Klesner, 1927, 47 S.Ct. 557, 274 U.S. 145, 71 L.Ed. 972, the Supreme Court ruled: “* * * The parallelism between the Supreme Court of the District [of Columbia] and the Court of Appeals of the District [of Columbia], on the one hand, and the district courts of the United States and the circuit courts of appeals, on the other, in the consideration and disposition of cases involving what among the States would be regarded as within Federal jurisdiction, is complete.” See also to the same effect Clairborne-Annapolis Ferry Company v. United States, 1932, 52 S.Ct. 440, 285 U.S. 382, 76 L.Ed. 808.

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §1 and section 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions (Apr. 12, 1900, ch. 191, §34, 31 Stat. 84; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §1, 36 Stat. 1087; Jan. 7, 1913; ch. 6, 37 Stat. 648; July 30, 1914, ch. 216, 38 Stat. 580; Mar. 2, 1917, ch. 145, §41, 39 Stat. 965; Mar. 4, 1921, ch. 161, §1, 41 Stat. 1412; Sept. 14, 1922, ch. 306, §1, 42 Stat. 837; Mar. 26, 1938, ch. 51, §2, 52 Stat. 118).

Section consolidates the last paragraph of section 1 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with portions of section 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with changes in phraseology necessary to effect consolidation.

Provisions of section 1 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to the number of judges in the various districts are incorporated in section 133 of this title.

A portion of section 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., is retained in said title 48. For remainder of section 863, see Distribution Table.

The exception in subsection (b) “except in the District of Columbia” conforms with the recent decision in U.S. ex. rel.
Laughlin v. Eicher, 1944, 56 F.Supp. 972, holding that residence requirement of section 1 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., did not apply to district judges in the District of Columbia. (See reviser's note under section 44 of this title.)

The clause in said last paragraph of section 1 of title 28 providing that any district judge, who violates the residence requirement, shall be deemed guilty of a high misdemeanor, was omitted.
This penalty provision was attached to the residence requirement at the time of compilation of the Revised Statutes of 1878, although it is apparent that Congress only intended that the penalty should be invoked upon the unauthorized practice of law.
See U.S. ex. rel.
Laughlin v. Eicher, supra, in which an outline of the history of said section 1 of title 28 is given.

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §5, and District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., §11–302 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §2, 36 Stat. 1087; Feb. 25, 1919, ch. 29, §1, 40 Stat. 1156; Dec. 13, 1926, ch. 6, 44 Stat. 919; May 17, 1932, ch. 190, 47 Stat. 158; July 31, 1946, ch. 704, §1, 60 Stat. 716).

Section consolidates section 5 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and section 11–302 of the District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed.

“Chief judge,” in the District of Columbia, was substituted for “Chief Justice” which appeared in section 11–302 of the District of Columbia Code. (See reviser's note under section 136 of this title.)

Words “to be paid in monthly installments” were omitted, since the time of payment is a matter of administrative convenience.
See 20 Comp.
Gen. 834.

The provision of section 5 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for salaries of judges of the district court of Alaska was omitted as covered by section 101 of Title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions, as amended by a separate section in the bill to enact this revised title.
The provision of said section for salary of the Virgin Islands district judge was omitted as covered by section 5a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., as amended by a separate section in the bill to enact this revised title.
Such section 5a is recommended for transfer to title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., because of the dual nature of the Virgin Islands district court.

For salary of the district judge of Canal Zone district court, see section 1348 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions.

Changes were made in phraseology.

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §375 and District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., §11–301 (Mar. 3, 1901, ch. 854, §§60, 61, 31 Stat. 1199; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §260, 36 Stat. 1161; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §289, 32 Stat. 1167; Feb. 25, 1919, ch. 29, §6, 40 Stat. 1157; Dec. 20, 1928, ch. 41, 45 Stat. 1056; Mar. 1, 1929, ch. 419, 45 Stat. 1422; June 19, 1930, ch. 537, 46 Stat. 785; May 31, 1938, ch. 290, §5, 52 Stat. 584).

Section consolidates portions of section 375 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and section 11–301 of the District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed.
The provisions of said section 375 relating to resignation and retirement of judges, and appointment of court officers, are incorporated in sections 294, 371, and 756 of this title.
Other provisions of said section 11–301 of the District of Columbia Code are incorporated in section 133 of this title.

Subsection (a), providing for a “chief judge” is new.
Such term replaces the terms “senior district judge,” and “Chief Justice” of the District Court in the District of Columbia.
It is employed in view of the great increase of administrative duties of such judge.
The use of the term “chief judge” with respect to the District of Columbia will result in uniform nomenclature for all district courts.
The district judges of that court have expressed approval of such designation.

The provision in said section 11–301 of the District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., that the “Chief Justice” shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, was omitted for the purpose of establishing a uniform method of creating the position of chief judge in all districts.
The District of Columbia is expressly made a judicial district by section 88 of this title.

Subsection (b) is new and conforms with similar provisions respecting associate justices of the Supreme Court and circuit judges in sections 4 and 45 of this title.

 Subsection (c) is from the proviso in the second paragraph of section 375 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which applied only in cases of appointment of court officers.
Here it is made applicable to all district judges.

Subsections (d) and (e) are new, and conform with section 44 of this title relating to precedence of circuit judges.

The official status of the Chief Justice of the District Court for the District of Columbia holding office at the effective date of this act is preserved by section 2 of the bill to enact revised title 28.

Savings Provision

Amendment by Pub. L. 97–164 not to apply or affect any person serving as chief judge on the effective date of Pub. L. 97–164 [Oct. 1, 1982], and the provisions of subsec. (a) of this section as in effect on the day before the effective date of part A of title II of Pub. L. 97–164 [Oct. 1, 1982] applicable to the chief judge of a district court serving on such effective date, see section 203 of Pub. L. 97–164, set out as a note under section 45 of this title.

§137. Division of business among district judges

The business of a court having more than one judge shall be divided among the judges as provided by the rules and orders of the court.

The chief judge of the district court shall be responsible for the observance of such rules and orders, and shall divide the business and assign the cases so far as such rules and orders do not otherwise prescribe.

If the district judges in any district are unable to agree upon the adoption of rules or orders for that purpose the judicial council of the circuit shall make the necessary orders.

(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 897.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §27 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §23, 36 Stat. 1090).

Section was rewritten and the practice simplified.
It provided for division of business and assignment of cases by agreement of judges and, in case of inability to agree, that the senior circuit judge of the circuit should make necessary orders.

The revised section is consistent with section 332 of this title, that the last paragraph of which requires the judicial council to make all necessary orders for the effective and expeditious administration of the business of the courts within the circuit.

Section Referred to in Other Sections

This section is referred to in title 48 section 1614.

§138. Terms abolished

Historical and Revision Notes

This section was substituted for a number of special provisions fixing stated times for holding terms of court in the several districts, in order to vest in the courts wider discretion and promote greater efficiency in the administration of the business of such courts.

§139. Times for holding regular sessions

The times for commencing regular sessions of the district court for transacting judicial business at the places fixed by this chapter shall be determined by the rules or orders of the court.
Such rules or orders may provide that at one or more of such places the court shall be in continuous session for such purposes on all business days throughout the year.
At other places a session of the court shall continue for such purposes until terminated by order of final adjournment or by commencement of the next regular session at the same place.

(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 897; Oct. 16, 1963, Pub. L. 88–139, §1, 77 Stat. 248.)

Historical and Revision Notes

The purpose of this section is to remove all doubt as to whether the mere beginning of a new term at one place ends a prior term begun at another place.
As revised, it conforms to a uniform course of judicial decisions.
See U.S. v. Perlstein, 39 F.Supp. 965, 968 (D.C.N.J. 1941), and cases cited.

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§16, 146, 182 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§12, 73, 101, 36 Stat. 1088, 1108, 1122; June 12, 1916, ch. 143, 39 Stat. 225; Feb. 20, 1917, ch. 102, 39 Stat. 927; June 13, 1918, ch. 98, 40 Stat. 604; Feb. 26, 1919, ch. 54, 40 Stat. 1184; May 29, 1924, ch. 209, 43 Stat. 243; June 5, 1924, ch. 259, 43 Stat. 387; Jan. 10, 1925, chs. 68, 69, 43 Stat. 730, 731; Feb. 16, 1925, ch. 233, §1, 43 Stat. 945; May 7, 1926, ch. 255, 44 Stat. 408; Apr. 21, 1928, ch. 395, 45 Stat. 440; Mar. 2, 1929, ch. 539, 45 Stat. 1518; June 28, 1930, ch. 714, 46 Stat. 829; May 13, 1936, ch. 386, 49 Stat. 1271; Aug. 12, 1937, ch. 595, 50 Stat. 625).

Section consolidates section 16 with the third sentence of section 146, and the final proviso in the third paragraph of section 182, all of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

Said section 16 of title 28 provided for adjournment by the marshal, or clerk, on written order of the judge, in case of inability of the district judge to attend at the commencement of any regular, adjourned or special term, or any time during such term.
Said sections 146 and 182 thereof, related to the district courts of Colorado and Oklahoma, only, and contained special provisions for adjournment.
Subsection (b) omits the requirement of written order where the judge is unable to make such order.

The revised section broadens these provisions, and vests discretionary power in the court, by order made anywhere within the district, to adjourn any term of court “for insufficient business or other good cause.” To establish uniformity, the special provisions relating to Colorado and Oklahoma were omitted.

Other provisions of said sections 146 and 182 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in sections 85 and 116 of this title.

The provision of subsection (a) authorizing the district court, with the consent of the judicial council of the circuit, to pretermit any term of court for insufficient business or other good cause, is inserted to obviate the expense and inconvenience of convening and adjourning a term for which no need exists.

§141. Special sessions; places; notice

Special sessions of the district court may be held at such places in the district as the nature of the business may require, and upon such notice as the court orders.

Any business may be transacted at a special session which might be transacted at a regular session.

(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 897; Oct. 16, 1963, Pub. L. 88–139, §1, 77 Stat. 248.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §15 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §11, 36 Stat. 1089).

Section was rewritten to include provision that notice of special terms should conform to rules approved by the judicial council of the circuit, thus insuring a uniform practice among the courts for convening special terms.

Changes of phraseology were made.

Historical and Revision Notes

The “Board of General Appraisers” was designated “United States Customs Court” by act May 28, 1926, ch. 411, §1, 44 Stat. 669. General provisions concerning such court were incorporated in section 1518 of title 19, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Customs Duties, until amended by act October 10, 1940, ch. 843, §1, 54 Stat. 1101, adding a new section to the Judicial Code of 1911, when they were transferred to section 296 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
They are retained in title 28 by this revision.

In this connection former Congressman Walter Chandler said, “Among the major subjects needing study and revision are special courts, such as the Customs Court, which should be fitted into the judicial system.” (See U.S. Law Weekly, Nov. 7, 1939.)

History of Court

The United States Customs Court [now Court of International Trade] as “constituted on June 17, 1930”, consisted of nine members as provided by act Sept. 21, 1922, ch. 356, title IV, §518, 42 Stat. 972, which established the Board of General Appraisers, designated the “United States Customs Court” by act May 28, 1926, ch. 411, §1, 44 Stat. 669.

Provisions similar to these were contained in act Sept. 21, 1922, ch. 356, title IV, §518, 42 Stat. 972. That section was superseded by section 518 of the Tariff Act of 1930, and was repealed by section 651 (a)(1) of said 1930 act.

The sentence in the former first paragraph as to sitting in a case previously participated in, is from act Aug. 5, 1909, ch. 6, §28, 36 Stat. 98, which combined and amended Customs Administrative Act June 10, 1890, ch. 407, §12, 26 Stat. 136, and section 31, as added by act May 27, 1908, ch. 205, 35 Stat. 406. Section 12 of the act of 1890 was expressly saved from repeal by act Sept. 21, 1922, ch. 356, title IV, §643, 42 Stat. 989, and prior acts, but its provisions, other than the sentence above mentioned, were omitted from the Code.

Provisions for the review of decisions of Boards of General Appraisers by the Circuit Courts, made by section 15 of the Customs Administrative Act of June 10, 1890, ch. 407, were superseded by provisions for such review by the Court of Customs Appeals created by section 29 added to that act by the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act of Aug. 5, 1909, ch. 6. The provisions of said new section 29 were incorporated in and superseded by chapter 8 of the Judicial Code of March 3, 1911, incorporated into the Code as former chapter 8 of Title 28, Judicial Code and Judiciary.

R.S. §2608 provided for the appointment of four appraisers of merchandise, to be employed in visiting ports of entry under the direction of the Secretary of the Treasury, and to assist in the appraisement of merchandise as might be deemed necessary by the Secretary to protect and insure uniformity in the collection of the revenue from customs.
It was repealed by act June 10, 1890, ch. 407, §29, 26 Stat. 141.

R.S. §2609 provided for the appointment of merchant appraisers. R.S. §2610 made every merchant refusing to serve as such appraiser liable to a penalty.
Both sections were superseded by the provisions relating to appraisers and appraisements of the Customs Administrative Act of June 10, 1890, ch. 407, 26 Stat. 131, and subsequent acts, and were repealed by act Sept. 21, 1922, ch. 356, title IV, §642, 42 Stat. 989.

R.S. §2945, which contained a provision similar to that of R.S. §2610, was repealed, without mention of section 2610, by said Customs Administrative Act of June 10, 1890, ch. 407, §29, 26 Stat. 141, and was again repealed by section 642 of act Sept. 21, 1922.

R.S. §2725, which prescribed the compensation of merchant appraisers, and section 2726, which prescribed the salary of the general appraiser at New York, were superseded by the provisions relating to general appraisers and appraisers made by the Customs Administrative Act of June 10, 1890, ch. 407, §§12, 13, 26 Stat. 136, as amended by the Payne-Aldrich Act of Aug. 5, 1909, ch. 6, §28.

R.S. §2727 fixed the salary of the four general appraisers at the sum of $2,500 a year each, and their actual traveling expenses.
It was repealed by act Feb. 27, 1877, ch. 69, 19 Stat. 246.

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §296 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §187(a), as added Oct. 10, 1940, ch. 843, §1, 54 Stat. 1101).

This section contains a part of section 296 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
Other provisions of such section are incorporated in sections 251, 252, 254, 456, 1581, 2071, 2639, and 2640 of this title.

Provision respecting recommendations for appointment, promotions, or otherwise affecting such clerical force, was omitted as unnecessary in view of section 871 of this title.

The second paragraph is partly new and conforms with similar provisions of section 136(e) of this title, relating to the chief judges of district courts.

The term “chief judge” was substituted for “presiding judge.” (See Reviser's Note under section 136 of this title.)

Changes were made in phraseology and arrangement.

§254. Single-judge trials

Except as otherwise provided in section 255 of this title, the judicial power of the Court of International Trade with respect to any action, suit or proceeding shall be exercised by a single judge, who may preside alone and hold a regular or special session of court at the same time other sessions are held by other judges.

Historical and Revision Notes

1948 Act

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §296 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, 187(a), as added Oct. 10, 1940, ch. 843, §1, 54 Stat. 1101).

This section contains a part of section 296 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
Other provisions of such section are incorporated in sections 251, 252, 253, 456, 1581, 2071, 2639, and 2640 of this title.

Words “when in the opinion of such division or judge the ends of justice so require,” which followed the phrase “grant a rehearing or retrial,” were omitted as surplusage.

The term “chief judge” was substituted for “presiding judge.” (See reviser's note under section 136 of this title.)

The phrase “petitions for remission of additional duties” was added to the first paragraph at the suggestion of the court to conform to existing practice.

Reappraisement appeals are heard by a single judge and reviewed by a division. (See sections 2631 and 2636 of this title.)

The provision of section 296 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the presiding judge shall designate one of the three judges of a division to preside over such division was omitted as in conflict with section 253 of this title (also taken from section 296 of title 28 U.S.C., 1940 ed.), which provides that judges shall preside according to the seniority of their commissions.
The latter provision is in accord with present practice.

Changes were made in arrangement and phraseology.

1949 Act

This amendment clarifies section 254 of title 28, U.S.C., by restoring language of the original law.

L. 102–572, title I, §104, 106 Stat. 4507.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§17, 22 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§13, 18, 36 Stat. 1089; Oct. 3, 1913, ch. 18, 38 Stat. 203; Sept. 14, 1922, ch. 306, §§3, 5, 42 Stat. 839; Mar. 2, 1929, ch. 488, §1, 45 Stat. 1475; June 7, 1934, ch. 426, 48 Stat. 926; June 25, 1936, ch. 804, 49 Stat. 1921; Aug. 24, 1937, ch. 754, §4, 50 Stat. 753; Dec. 29, 1942, ch. 835, §1, 56 Stat. 1094).

Section consolidates all provisions of sections 17 and 22 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to designation and assignment of circuit judges.

The revised section omits a reference to the Chief Justice contained in said section 22, since in exercising the powers under subsection (b), he acts as a circuit justice.

Paragraph (d) of said section 17, making the section applicable to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, is omitted since such court is included in this revision because the District of Columbia is made a separate circuit. (See section 41 of this title.)

Provisions of said sections 17 and 22 authorizing the senior Associate Justice to act in the absence of the Chief Justice of the United States were omitted as surplusage in view of specific authority to so act in section 3 of this title.

The words in said section 17 “for such time as the business of such district court may require,” were omitted as inconsistent with the language of said section 22 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which employed the words “the public interest requires” and “from time to time and until he shall otherwise direct.” The revised section and sections 294 and 296 of this title make clear the power to make designation and assignment without any limitation of time, to revoke such designation and assignment and to make, from time to time, new designations and assignments.

The term “chief judge” of the circuit was substituted for “senior circuit judge.” (See reviser's note under section 136 of this title.)

References in said sections 17 and 22 to retired judges were omitted as covered by section 294 of this title.

Other provisions of said section 17 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in sections 292, 295 and 296 of this title.

Other provisions of said section 22 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in section 296 of this title.

Changes were made in phraseology and arrangement.

Jurisdiction of United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals

Section 7 of Pub. L. 85–755 provided that: “Nothing contained in this Act [amending this section and sections 211 and 292 to 295 of this title] shall be construed in any way to limit or alter the jurisdiction heretofore conferred upon the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals [now United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit] by any provision of law.”

§292. District judges

(a) The chief judge of a circuit may designate and assign one or more district judges within the circuit to sit upon the court of appeals or a division thereof whenever the business of that court so requires.
Such designations or assignments shall be in conformity with the rules or orders of the court of appeals of the circuit.

(b) The chief judge of a circuit may, in the public interest, designate and assign temporarily any district judge of the circuit to hold a district court in any district within the circuit.

(c) The chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit may, upon presentation of a certificate of necessity by the chief judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia pursuant to section 11–908(c) of the District of Columbia Code, designate and assign temporarily any district judge of the circuit to serve as a judge of such Superior Court, if such assignment (1) is approved by the Attorney General of the United States following a determination by him to the effect that such assignment is necessary to meet the ends of justice, and (2) is approved by the chief judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.

(d) The Chief Justice of the United States may designate and assign temporarily a district judge of one circuit for service in another circuit, either in a district court or court of appeals, upon presentation of a certificate of necessity by the chief judge or circuit justice of the circuit wherein the need arises.

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§17, 21 and 216 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§13, 17, 120, 36 Stat. 1089, 1132; Sept. 14, 1922, ch. 306, §3, 42 Stat. 839; Aug. 24, 1937, ch. 754, §4, 50 Stat. 753; Dec. 29, 1942, ch. 835, §1, 56 Stat. 1094).

Section consolidates and simplifies all provisions of sections 17, 21 and 216 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to designation and assignment of district judges.

Term “chief judge” was substituted for “senior circuit judge.” (See Reviser's Note under section 136 of this title.)

Sections 17 and 21 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were inconsistent insofar as the words “or in his absence, the circuit judges thereof,” appearing in said section 17 were not in section 21, and the words “senior circuit judge then present in the circuit,” appearing in section 21 were not in section 17. The revised section omits all such words and leaves designation of assignment to the chief judge of the circuit.
If the chief judge is unable to perform his duties they devolve, under section 45 of this title, upon the circuit judge next in seniority of commission.

The provision of said section 17, that designation of a district judge to another circuit should be from an adjacent circuit if practicable, was omitted as an unnecessary restriction on the discretion of the Chief Justice.

Section 19 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., is omitted as unnecessary.
It authorized the Chief Justice of the United States to designate and assign any district judge to a district upon receiving a certificate from the clerk of the district that all circuit judges and the circuit justice were absent from the circuit, or were unable to appoint a substitute judge for the district,or where the district judge actually designated was disabled or neglected to hold court.

For omission of reference in said section 17 to senior Associate Justice, see reviser's note under section 291 of this title.

Reference in said section 17 to retired judges were omitted as covered by section 294 of this title.

Other provisions of said section 17 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in sections 291, 295, and 296 of this title.
Other provisions of said section 216 of such title are incorporated in sections 45 and 47 of this title.

Words “either in a district court or court of appeals” were inserted in subsection (c) as suggested by Hon.
Learned Hand, Senior Circuit Judge of the Second Circuit.
The revised section permits a district judge to be assigned directly to the circuit court of appeals of another circuit.
Under existing law it has been assumed that he must be assigned to serve as a district judge on the other circuit and then designated to serve on the circuit court of appeals by that court in which his services are required.

Many changes were made in phraseology.

(d) The Chief Justice of the United States shall maintain a roster of retired judges of the United States who are willing and able to undertake special judicial duties from time to time outside their own circuit, in the case of a retired circuit or district judge, or in a court other than their own, in the case of other retired judges, which roster shall be known as the roster or senior judges.
Any such retired judge of the United States may be designated and assigned by the Chief Justice to perform such judicial duties as he is willing and able to undertake in a court outside his own circuit, in the case of a retired circuit or district judge, or in a court other than his own, in the case of any other retired judge of the United States.
Such designation and assignment to a court of appeals or district court shall be made upon the presentation of a certificate of necessity by the chief judge or circuit justice of the circuit wherein the need arises and to any other court of the United States upon the presentation of a certificate of necessity by the chief judge of such court.
No such designation or assignment shall be made to the Supreme Court.

(e) No retired justice or judge shall perform judicial duties except when designated and assigned.

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§17, 18, 22, 23, 301 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§13, 14, 18, 19, 188, 36 Stat. 1089, 1143; Oct. 3, 1913, ch. 18, 38 Stat. 203; Feb. 25, 1919, ch. 29, §§2, 5, 40 Stat. 1156, 1157; Sept. 14, 1922, ch. 306, §§3, 4, 5, 42 Stat. 839; Dec. 13, 1926, ch. 6, §1, 44 Stat. 919; Mar. 2, 1929, ch. 488, §1, 45 Stat. 1475; June 7, 1934, ch. 426, 48 Stat. 926; June 25, 1936, ch. 804, 49 Stat. 1921; Aug. 24, 1937, ch. 754, §4, 50 Stat. 753; Dec. 29, 1942, ch. 835, §§1, 2, 5, 6, 56 Stat. 1094, 1095).

Section simplifies provisions of sections 17, 18, paragraphs (b) and (c) of section 22, and sections 23 and 301 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to powers and duties of designated judges.

Other provisions of said sections 17 and 22 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in sections 291, 292, and 295 of this title.

Other provisions of said section 301 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in sections 211–213, 215, and 293 of this title.

Section is made applicable to retired justices of the Supreme Court by inclusion of reference to “justice,” on the theory that a justice should have the same powers and duties and be subject to the same limitations as designated and assigned circuit and district judges.

The second sentence of the revised section was substituted for the provision of section 18 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which subjected circuit judges to the same assignments of duty as the circuit judges of the circuit to which they are designated and assigned.
The revised section extends this requirement and makes it applicable to all designated and assigned judges.

The provision in the last paragraph of said section 22 that the action of the assigned judge in writing filed with the clerk of court where the trial or hearing was held shall be valid as if such action had been taken by him within the district and within the period of his designation, was omitted as surplusage.
See section 295 of this title.

§297. Assignment of judges to courts of the freely associated compact states

(a) The Chief Justice or the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit may assign any circuit or district judge of the Ninth Circuit, with the consent of the judge so assigned, to serve temporarily as a judge of any duly constituted court of the freely associated compact states whenever an official duly authorized by the laws of the respective compact state requests such assignment and such assignment is necessary for the proper dispatch of the business of the respective court.

(b) The Congress consents to the acceptance and retention by any judge so authorized of reimbursement from the countries referred to in subsection (a) of all necessary travel expenses, including transportation, and of subsistence, or of a reasonable per diem allowance in lieu of subsistence.

The Chief Justice of the United States shall summon annually the chief judge of each judicial circuit, the chief judge of the Court of International Trade, and a district judge from each judicial circuit to a conference at such time and place in the United States as he may designate.
He shall preside at such conference which shall be known as the Judicial Conference of the United States.
Special sessions of the Conference may be called by the Chief Justice at such times and places as he may designate.

The district judge to be summoned from each judicial circuit shall be chosen by the circuit and district judges of the circuit at the annual judicial conference of the circuit held pursuant to section 333 of this title and shall serve as a member of the conference for three successive years, except that in the year following the enactment of this amended section the judges in the first, fourth, seventh, and tenth circuits shall choose a district judge to serve for one year, the judges in the second, fifth, and eighth circuits shall choose a district judge to serve for two years and the judges in the third, sixth, ninth, and District of Columbia circuits shall choose a district judge to serve for three years.

If the chief judge of any circuit, the chief judge of the Court of International Trade, or the district judge chosen by the judges of the circuit is unable to attend, the Chief Justice may summon any other circuit or district judge from such circuit or any other judge of the Court of International Trade, as the case may be.
Every judge summoned shall attend and, unless excused by the Chief Justice, shall remain throughout the sessions of the conference and advise as to the needs of his circuit or court and as to any matters in respect of which the administration of justice in the courts of the United States may be improved.

The Conference shall make a comprehensive survey of the condition of business in the courts of the United States and prepare plans for assignment of judges to or from circuits or districts where necessary.
It shall also submit suggestions and recommendations to the various courts to promote uniformity of management procedures and the expeditious conduct of court business.
The Conference is authorized to exercise the authority provided in section 372(c) of this title as the Conference, or through a standing committee.
If the Conference elects to establish a standing committee, it shall be appointed by the Chief Justice and all petitions for review shall be reviewed by that committee.
The Conference or the standing committee may hold hearings, take sworn testimony, issue subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum, and make necessary and appropriate orders in the exercise of its authority.
Subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum shall be issued by the clerk of the Supreme Court or by the clerk of any court of appeals, at the direction of the Chief Justice or his designee and under the seal of the court, and shall be served in the manner provided in rule 45(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum issued on behalf of the United States or an officer or any agency thereof.
The Conference may also prescribe and modify rules for the exercise of the authority provided in section 372(c) of this title.
All judicial officers and employees of the United States shall promptly carry into effect all orders of the Judicial Conference or the standing committee established pursuant to this section.

The Conference shall also carry on a continuous study of the operation and effect of the general rules of practice and procedure now or hereafter in use as prescribed by the Supreme Court for the other courts of the United States pursuant to law.
Such changes in and additions to those rules as the Conference may deem desirable to promote simplicity in procedure, fairness in administration, the just determination of litigation, and the elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay shall be recommended by the Conference from time to time to the Supreme Court for its consideration and adoption, modification or rejection, in accordance with law.

The Judicial Conference shall review rules prescribed under section 2071 of this title by the courts, other than the Supreme Court and the district courts, for consistency with Federal law.
The Judicial Conference may modify or abrogate any such rule so reviewed found inconsistent in the course of such a review.

The Attorney General shall, upon request of the Chief Justice, report to such Conference on matters relating to the business of the several courts of the United States, with particular reference to cases to which the United States is a party.

The Chief Justice shall submit to Congress an annual report of the proceedings of the Judicial Conference and its recommendations for legislation.

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §218 (Sept. 14, 1922, ch. 306, §2, 42 Stat. 838; July 5, 1937, ch. 427, 50 Stat. 473).

Provisions as to associate justice acting when Chief Justice is disabled are omitted as unnecessary in view of section 3 of this title giving senior associate justice power to act upon the disability of the Chief Justice.

The provision of section 218 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., as to traveling expenses is incorporated in section 456 of this title.

Provision as to time and place for holding conference was omitted as unnecessary since the Chief Justice is vested with discretionary power to designate the time and place under the language retained.

The references to “chief judge” are in harmony with other sections of this title. (See Reviser's Note under section 136 of this title.)

Provision for stated annual reports by the chief judge of the district was omitted as obsolete and unnecessary in view of sections 332 and 333 of this title.

The last paragraph is new and is inserted to authorize the communication to Congress of information which now reaches that body only because incorporated in the annual report of the Attorney General.

Numerous changes were made in phraseology and arrangement.

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §448 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §306, as added Aug. 7, 1939, ch. 501, §1, 53 Stat. 1223).

The final sentence of section 448 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., excepting from the operation of said section the provisions of existing law as to assignment of district judges outside their districts, was omitted as surplusage, since there is nothing in this section in conflict with section 292 of this title providing for such assignments.

(e) Notwithstanding subsection (c) of section 5532 of title 5, if a regular or reserve member or former member of a uniformed service who is receiving retired or retainer pay becomes employed as a justice or judge of the United States, as defined by section 451, or becomes eligible therefor while so employed, such retired or retainer pay shall not be paid during regular active service as a justice or judge, but shall be resumed or commenced without reduction upon retirement from the judicial office or from regular active service (into senior status) as such justice or judge.

(f)(1) In order to continue receiving the salary of the office under subsection (b), a justice must be certified in each calendar year by the Chief Justice, and a judge must be certified by the chief judge of the circuit in which the judge sits, as having met the requirements set forth in at least one of the following subparagraphs:

(A) The justice or judge must have carried in the preceding calendar year a caseload involving courtroom participation which is equal to or greater than the amount of work involving courtroom participation which an average judge in active service would perform in three months.
In the instance of a justice or judge who has sat on both district courts and courts of appeals, the caseload of appellate work and trial work shall be determined separately and the results of those determinations added together for purposes of this paragraph.

(B) The justice or judge performed in the preceding calendar year substantial judicial duties not involving courtroom participation under subparagraph (A), including settlement efforts, motion decisions, writing opinions in cases that have not been orally argued, and administrative duties for the court to which the justice or judge is assigned.
Any certification under this subparagraph shall include a statement describing in detail the nature and amount of work and certifying that the work done is equal to or greater than the work described in this subparagraph which an average judge in active service would perform in three months.

(C) The justice or judge has, in the preceding calendar year, performed work described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) in an amount which, when calculated in accordance with such subparagraphs, in the aggregate equals at least 3 months work.

(D) The justice or judge has, in the preceding calendar year, performed substantial administrative duties directly related to the operation of the courts, or has performed substantial duties for a Federal or State governmental entity.
A certification under this subparagraph shall specify that the work done is equal to the full-time work of an employee of the judicial branch.

(E) The justice or judge was unable in the preceding calendar year to perform judicial or administrative work to the extent required by any of subparagraphs (A) through (D) because of a temporary or permanent disability.
A certification under this subparagraph shall be made to a justice who certifies in writing his or her disability to the Chief Justice, and to a judge who certifies in writing his or her disability to the chief judge of the circuit in which the judge sits.
A justice or judge who is certified under this subparagraph as having a permanent disability shall be deemed to have met the requirements of this subsection for each calendar year thereafter.

(2) Determinations of work performed under subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (D) of paragraph (1) shall be made pursuant to rules promulgated by the Judicial Conference of the United States.
In promulgating such criteria, the Judicial Conference shall take into account existing standards promulgated by the Conference for allocation of space and staff for senior judges.

(3) If in any year a justice or judge who retires under subsection (b) does not receive a certification under this subsection (except as provided in paragraph (1)(E)), he or she is thereafter ineligible to receive such a certification.

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§375 and 375a (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §260, 36 Stat. 1161; Feb. 25, 1919, ch. 29, §6, 40 Stat. 1157; Mar. 1, 1929, ch. 419, 45 Stat. 1422; Mar. 1, 1937, ch. 21, §§1, 2, 50 Stat. 24; Feb. 11, 1938, ch. 25, §1, 52 Stat. 28; May 11, 1944, ch. 192, §1, 58 Stat. 218).

This section consolidates provisions of sections 375 and 375a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to resignation and retirement.
Remaining provisions of said section 375 now appear in sections 136, 294, and 756 of this title, and remaining provisions of said section 375a now appear in section 294 of this title.

Words “may resign, or may retain his office but retire from regular active service” were used to clarify the difference between resignation and retirement.
Resignation results in loss of the judge's office, while retirement does not. (Booth v. U.S., 1933, 54 S. Ct. 379, 291 U.S. 339, 78 L. Ed. 836; U.S. v. Moore, 1939, 101 F. 2d 56, certiorari denied 59 S. Ct. 788, 306 U.S. 664, 83 L. Ed. 1060.)

Terms “judge of the United States” and “justice of the United States” are defined in section 451 of this title.

The revised section continues the provision respecting the salary of a resigned judge but changes such provision for retired judges and makes them eligible to receive any increases provided by Congress for the office from which they retired.
This change is in harmony with the clear line of distinction drawn by Congress between retirement and resignation.

Computation of Judicial Service, District of Alaska

Pub. L. 89–70, July 8, 1965, 79 Stat. 213, provided: “That, notwithstanding any other provision of law, any service as a judge of the District Court for the Territory of Alaska shall be included in computing under sections 371 and 372 of Title 28, United States Code, the aggregate years of judicial service of a United States district judge for the district of Alaska.”

Judicial Service in Hawaii Included Within Computation of Aggregate Years of Judicial Service

Pub. L. 86–3, §14(d), Mar. 18, 1959, 73 Stat. 10, provided in part: “That service as a judge of the District Court for the Territory of Hawaii or as a judge of the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii or as a justice of the Supreme Court of the Territory of Hawaii or as a judge of the circuit courts of the Territory of Hawaii shall be included in computing under section 371, 372, or 373 of title 28, United States Code, the aggregate years of judicial service of any person who is in office as a district judge for the District of Hawaii on the date of enactment of this Act [Mar. 18, 1959].”

§372. Retirement for disability; substitute judge on failure to retire; judicial discipline

(a) Any justice or judge of the United States appointed to hold office during good behavior who becomes permanently disabled from performing his duties may retire from regular active service, and the President shall, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, appoint a successor.

Any justice or judge of the United States desiring to retire under this section shall certify to the President his disability in writing.

Whenever an associate justice of the Supreme Court, a chief judge of a circuit or the chief judge of the Court of International Trade, desires to retire under this section, he shall furnish to the President a certificate of disability signed by the Chief Justice of the United States.

A circuit or district judge, desiring to retire under this section, shall furnish to the President a certificate of disability signed by the chief judge of his circuit.

A judge of the Court of International Trade desiring to retire under this section, shall furnish to the President a certificate of disability signed by the chief judge of his court.

A justice or judge retiring under this section who has served less than ten years in all shall, during the remainder of his lifetime, receive one-half the salary of the office.

(b) Whenever any judge of the United States appointed to hold office during good behavior who is eligible to retire under this section does not do so and a certificate of his disability signed by a majority of the members of the Judicial Council of his circuit in the case of a circuit or district judge, or by the Chief Justice of the United States in the case of the Chief Judge of the Court of International Trade, or by the chief judge of his court in the case of a judge of the Court of International Trade, is presented to the President and the President finds that such judge is unable to discharge efficiently all the duties of his office by reason of permanent mental or physical disability and that the appointment of an additional judge is necessary for the efficient dispatch of business, the President may make such appointment by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.
Whenever any such additional judge is appointed, the vacancy subsequently caused by the death, resignation, or retirement of the disabled judge shall not be filled.
Any judge whose disability causes the appointment of an additional judge shall, for purpose of precedence, service as chief judge, or temporary performance of the duties of that office, be treated as junior in commission to the other judges of the circuit, district, or court.

(c)(1) Any person alleging that a circuit, district, or bankruptcy judge, or a magistrate, has engaged in conduct prejudicial to the effective and expeditious administration of the business of the courts, or alleging that such a judge or magistrate is unable to discharge all the duties of office by reason of mental or physical disability, may file with the clerk of the court of appeals for the circuit a written complaint containing a brief statement of the facts constituting such conduct.
In the interests of the effective and expeditious administration of the business of the courts and on the basis of information available to the chief judge of the circuit, the chief judge may, by written order stating reasons therefor, identify a complaint for purposes of this subsection and thereby dispense with filing of a written complaint.

(2) Upon receipt of a complaint filed under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the clerk shall promptly transmit such complaint to the chief judge of the circuit, or, if the conduct complained of is that of the chief judge, to that circuit judge in regular active service next senior in date of commission (hereafter, for purposes of this subsection only, included in the term “chief judge”). The clerk shall simultaneously transmit a copy of the complaint to the judge or magistrate whose conduct is the subject of the complaint.

(3) After expeditiously reviewing a complaint, the chief judge, by written order stating his reasons, may—

(A) dismiss the complaint, if he finds it to be (i) not in conformity with paragraph (1) of this subsection, (ii) directly related to the merits of a decision or procedural ruling, or (iii) frivolous; or

(B) conclude the proceeding if he finds that appropriate corrective action has been taken or that action on the complaint is no longer necessary because of intervening events.

The chief judge shall transmit copies of his written order to the complainant and to the judge or magistrate whose conduct is the subject of the complaint.

(4) If the chief judge does not enter an order under paragraph (3) of this subsection, such judge shall promptly—

(A) appoint himself and equal numbers of circuit and district judges of the circuit to a special committee to investigate the facts and allegations contained in the complaint;

(B) certify the complaint and any other documents pertaining thereto to each member of such committee; and

(C) provide written notice to the complainant and the judge or magistrate whose conduct is the subject of the complaint of the action taken under this paragraph.

A judge appointed to a special committee under this paragraph may continue to serve on that committee after becoming a senior judge or, in the case of the chief judge of the circuit, after his or her term as chief judge terminates under subsection (a)(3) or (c) of section 45 of this title.
If a judge appointed to a committee under this paragraph dies, or retires from office under section 371(a) of this title, while serving on the committee, the chief judge of the circuit may appoint another circuit or district judge, as the case may be, to the committee.

(5) Each committee appointed under paragraph (4) of this subsection shall conduct an investigation as extensive as it considers necessary, and shall expeditiously file a comprehensive written report thereon with the judicial council of the circuit.
Such report shall present both the findings of the investigation and the committee's recommendations for necessary and appropriate action by the judicial council of the circuit.

(6) Upon receipt of a report filed under paragraph (5) of this subsection, the judicial council—

(A) may conduct any additional investigation which it considers to be necessary;

(B) shall take such action as is appropriate to assure the effective and expeditious administration of the business of the courts within the circuit, including, but not limited to, any of the following actions:

(i) directing the chief judge of the district of the magistrate whose conduct is the subject of the complaint to take such action as the judicial council considers appropriate;

(ii) certifying disability of a judge appointed to hold office during good behavior whose conduct is the subject of the complaint, pursuant to the procedures and standards provided under subsection (b) of this section;

(iii) requesting that any such judge appointed to hold office during good behavior voluntarily retire, with the provision that the length of service requirements under section 371 of this title shall not apply;

(iv) ordering that, on a temporary basis for a time certain, no further cases be assigned to any judge or magistrate whose conduct is the subject of a complaint;

(v) censuring or reprimanding such judge or magistrate by means of private communication;

(vi) censuring or reprimanding such judge or magistrate by means of public announcement; or

(vii) ordering such other action as it considers appropriate under the circumstances, except that (I) in no circumstances may the council order removal from office of any judge appointed to hold office during good behavior, and (II) any removal of a magistrate shall be in accordance with section 631 of this title and any removal of a bankruptcy judge shall be in accordance with section 152 of this title;

(C) may dismiss the complaint; and

(D) shall immediately provide written notice to the complainant and to such judge or magistrate of the action taken under this paragraph.

(7)(A) In addition to the authority granted under paragraph (6) of this subsection, the judicial council may, in its discretion, refer any complaint under this subsection, together with the record of any associated proceedings and its recommendations for appropriate action, to the Judicial Conference of the United States.

(B) In any case in which the judicial council determines, on the basis of a complaint and an investigation under this subsection, or on the basis of information otherwise available to the council, that a judge appointed to hold office during good behavior may have engaged in conduct—

(i) which might constitute one or more grounds for impeachment under article II of the Constitution; or

(ii) which, in the interest of justice, is not amenable to resolution by the judicial council,

the judicial council shall promptly certify such determination, together with any complaint and a record of any associated proceedings, to the Judicial Conference of the United States.

(C) A judicial council acting under authority of this paragraph shall, unless contrary to the interests of justice, immediately submit written notice to the complainant and to the judge or magistrate whose conduct is the subject of the action taken under this paragraph.

(8)(A) Upon referral or certification of any matter under paragraph (7) of this subsection, the Judicial Conference, after consideration of the prior proceedings and such additional investigation as it considers appropriate, shall by majority vote take such action, as described in paragraph (6)(B) of this subsection, as it considers appropriate.
If the Judicial Conference concurs in the determination of the council, or makes its own determination, that consideration of impeachment may be warranted, it shall so certify and transmit the determination and the record of proceedings to the House of Representatives for whatever action the House of Representatives considers to be necessary.
Upon receipt of the determination and record of proceedings in the House of Representatives, the Clerk of the House of Representatives shall make available to the public the determination and any reasons for the determination.

(B) If a judge or magistrate has been convicted of a felony and has exhausted all means of obtaining direct review of the conviction, or the time for seeking further direct review of the conviction has passed and no such review has been sought, the Judicial Conference may, by majority vote and without referral or certification under paragraph (7), transmit to the House of Representatives a determination that consideration of impeachment may be warranted, together with appropriate court records, for whatever action the House of Representatives considers to be necessary.

(9)(A) In conducting any investigation under this subsection, the judicial council, or a special committee appointed under paragraph (4) of this subsection, shall have full subpoena powers as provided in section 332(d) of this title.

(B) In conducting any investigation under this subsection, the Judicial Conference, or a standing committee appointed by the Chief Justice under section 331 of this title, shall have full subpoena powers as provided in that section.

A complainant, judge, or magistrate aggrieved by an action of the judicial council under paragraph (6) of this subsection may petition the Judicial Conference of the United States for review thereof.
The Judicial Conference, or the standing committee established under section 331 of this title, may grant a petition filed by a complainant, judge, or magistrate under this paragraph.
Except as expressly provided in this paragraph, all orders and determinations, including denials of petitions for review, shall be final and conclusive and shall not be judicially reviewable on appeal or otherwise.

(11) Each judicial council and the Judicial Conference may prescribe such rules for the conduct of proceedings under this subsection, including the processing of petitions for review, as each considers to be appropriate.
Such rules shall contain provisions requiring that—

(A) adequate prior notice of any investigation be given in writing to the judge or magistrate whose conduct is the subject of the complaint;

(B) the judge or magistrate whose conduct is the subject of the complaint be afforded an opportunity to appear (in person or by counsel) at proceedings conducted by the investigating panel, to present oral and documentary evidence, to compel the attendance of witnesses or the production of documents, to cross-examine witnesses, and to present argument orally or in writing; and

(C) the complainant be afforded an opportunity to appear at proceedings conducted by the investigating panel, if the panel concludes that the complainant could offer substantial information.

Any such rule shall be made or amended only after giving appropriate public notice and an opportunity for comment.
Any rule promulgated under this subsection shall be a matter of public record, and any such rule promulgated by a judicial council may be modified by the Judicial Conference.
No rule promulgated under this subsection may limit the period of time within which a person may file a complaint under this subsection.

(12) No judge or magistrate whose conduct is the subject of an investigation under this subsection shall serve upon a special committee appointed under paragraph (4) of this subsection, upon a judicial council, upon the Judicial Conference, or upon the standing committee established under section 331 of this title, until all related proceedings under this subsection have been finally terminated.

(13) No person shall be granted the right to intervene or to appear as amicus curiae in any proceeding before a judicial council or the Judicial Conference under this subsection.

(B) the judicial council of the circuit, the Judicial Conference of the United States, or the Senate or the House of Representatives by resolution, releases any such material which is believed necessary to an impeachment investigation or trial of a judge under article I of the Constitution; or

(C) such disclosure is authorized in writing by the judge or magistrate who is the subject of the complaint and by the chief judge of the circuit, the Chief Justice, or the chairman of the standing committee established under section 331 of this title.

(15) Each written order to implement any action under paragraph (6)(B) of this subsection, which is issued by a judicial council, the Judicial Conference, or the standing committee established under section 331 of this title, shall be made available to the public through the appropriate clerk's office of the court of appeals for the circuit.
Unless contrary to the interests of justice, each such order issued under this paragraph shall be accompanied by written reasons therefor.

(16) Upon the request of a judge or magistrate whose conduct is the subject of a complaint under this subsection, the judicial council may, if the complaint has been finally dismissed under paragraph (6)(C), recommend that the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts award reimbursement, from funds appropriated to the Federal judiciary, for those reasonable expenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred by that judge or magistrate during the investigation which would not have been incurred but for the requirements of this subsection.

(17) Except as expressly provided in this subsection, nothing in this subsection shall be construed to affect any other provision of this title, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, or the Federal Rules of Evidence.

(18) The United States Court of Federal Claims, the Court of International Trade, and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit shall each prescribe rules, consistent with the foregoing provisions of this subsection, establishing procedures for the filing of complaints with respect to the conduct of any judge of such court and for the investigation and resolution of such complaints.

Historical and Revision Notes

1948 Act

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§375b, 375c, and 375d (Aug. 5, 1939, ch. 433, §§1–3, 53 Stat. 1204, 1205).

This section consolidates sections 375b, 375c, and 375d of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

Section 375e of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. providing that term “senior circuit judge” includes the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and the term “judicial circuit” includes the District of Columbia, was omitted from this revision as unnecessary.
Such district is included as a judicial circuit by section 41 of this title.

Words “justice or judge of the United States” were used to describe members of all courts who hold office during good behavior. (See reviser's note under section 371 of this title.)

Term “chief judge” was substituted for “Chief Justice” of the Court of Claims, “presiding judge” of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and “senior circuit judge.” (See Reviser's Note under section 136 of this title.)

For clarity and convenience the requirement that certificates of disability be submitted “to the President,” was made explicit.

The revised section requires a judge of the Customs Court to furnish a certificate of disability signed by the chief judge of his court, instead of by the chief judge of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals as in said section 375c of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
This change insures signing of the certificate of disability by the chief judge possessing knowledge of the facts.

Changes were made in phraseology and arrangement.

1949 Act

Subsection (a) of this section amends section 372 of title 28, U.S.C., to express the requirement that appointment of successors to justices or judges must be made with confirmation by the Senate.
Subsection (b) of this section clarifies the intent of section 372 of title 28, U.S.C., and conforms with the language of section 371 of such title.

(c)(1) There shall also be deposited to the credit of the Judicial Survivors’ Annuities Fund, in accordance with such procedures as the Comptroller General of the United States may prescribe, amounts required to reduce to zero the unfunded liability of the Judicial Survivors’ Annuities Fund: Provided, That such amounts shall not exceed the equivalent of 9 percent of salary or retirement salary.
Such deposits shall, subject to appropriations Acts, be taken from the fund used to pay the compensation of the judicial official, and shall immediately become an integrated part of the Judicial Survivors’ Annuities Fund for any use required under this section.

(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term “unfunded liability” means the estimated excess, determined on an annual basis in accordance with the provisions of section 9503 of title 31, United States Code, of the present value of all benefits payable from the Judicial Survivors’ Annuities Fund, over the sum of—

(A) the present value of deductions to be withheld from the future basic pay of judicial officials; plus

(B) the balance in the Fund as of the date the unfunded liability is determined.

In making any determination under this paragraph, the Comptroller General shall use the applicable information contained in the reports filed pursuant to section 9503 of title 31, United States Code, with respect to the judicial survivors’ annuities plan established by this section.

(3) There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out this subsection.

(d) Each judicial official shall deposit, with interest at 4 percent per annum to December 31, 1947, and at 3 percent per annum thereafter, compounded on December 31 of each year, to the credit of the “Judicial Survivors’ Annuities Fund”:

(1) a sum equal to 3.5 percent of that salary, including “retirement salary”, which he or she has received for serving in any of the offices designated in paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this section prior to the date upon which he or she filed notice of an intention to come within the purview of this section with the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts; and

(2) a sum equal to 3.5 percent of the basic salary, pay, or compensation which he or she has received for serving as a Senator, Representative, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner in Congress, or for serving as an “employee”, as that term is defined in subsection (1) of section 8331 of title 5, prior to assuming the responsibilities of any of the offices designated in paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this section.

The interest otherwise required by this subsection shall not be required for any period during which a judicial official was separated from all such service and was not receiving any retirement salary.

Each such judicial official may elect to make such deposits in installments, during the continuance of his or her service in those offices designated in paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this section, in such amounts and under such conditions as may be determined in each instance by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts: Provided, That, in each instance in which a judicial official does elect to make such deposits in installments, the Director shall require (i) that the first installment payment made shall be in an amount no smaller than that amount necessary to cover at least the last eighteen months of prior creditable civilian service, and (ii) that at least one additional installment payment shall be made every eighteen months thereafter until the total of all such deposits have been made.

Notwithstanding the failure of any such judicial official to make all such deposits or installment payments, credit shall be allowed for the service rendered, but the annuity of that judicial official's widow or widower shall be reduced by an amount equal to 10 percent of the amount of such deposits, computed as of the date of the death of such judicial official, unless such widow or widower shall elect to eliminate such service entirely from credit under subsection (k) of this section: Provided, That no deposit shall be required from any such judicial official for any honorable active duty service in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard of the United States, or for any other creditable service rendered prior to August 1, 1920.

(e) The amounts deducted and withheld in accordance with subsection (b) of this section, and the amounts deposited in accordance with subsection (d) of this section, shall be credited to individual accounts in the name of each judicial official from whom such amounts are received, for credit to the “Judicial Survivors’ Annuities Fund”.

(f) The Secretary of the Treasury shall invest, from time to time, in interest bearing securities of the United States or Federal farm loan bonds, those portions of the “Judicial Survivors’ Annuities Fund” which in his judgment may not be immediately required for the payment of annuities, refunds, and allowances as provided in this section.
The income derived from such investments shall constitute a part of such fund for the purposes of paying annuities and carrying out the provisions of subsections (g), (h), (m), (o), (p), and (q) of this section.

(g) If any judicial official leaves office and is ineligible to receive a retirement salary or leaves office and is entitled to a deferred retirement salary but fails to make an election under subsection (b)(2) of this section, all amounts credited to his or her account established under subsection (e), together with interest at 4 percent per annum to December 31, 1947, and at 3 percent per annum thereafter, compounded on December 31 of each year, to the date of his or her relinquishment of office, minus a sum equal to 2.2 percent of salary for service while deductions were withheld under subsection (b) or for which a deposit was made by the judicial official under subsection (d), shall be returned to that judicial official in a lump-sum payment within a reasonable period of time following the date of his or her relinquishment of office.
For the purposes of this section, a “reasonable period of time” shall be presumed to be no longer than 1 year following the date upon which such judicial official relinquishes his or her office.

(h) Annuities payable under this section shall be paid only in accordance with the following provisions:

(1) In any case in which a judicial official dies while in office, while receiving retirement salary, or after filing an election and otherwise complying with the conditions under subsection (b)(2) of this section (A) after having completed at least eighteen months of creditable civilian service, as computed in accordance with subsection (k) of this section, for the last eighteen months of which the salary deductions provided by subsection (b) of this section or, in lieu thereof, the deposits required by subsection (d) of this section have actually been made, or (B) if the death of such judicial official was by assassination, before having satisfied the requirements of clause (A) if, for the period of such service, the deductions provided by subsection (b) or, in lieu thereof, the deposits required by subsection (d) have actually been made—

(i) if such judicial official is survived by a widow or widower, but not by a child, there shall be paid to such widow or widower an annuity, beginning on the day on which such judicial official died, in an amount computed as provided in subsection (l) of this section; or

(ii) if such judicial official is survived by a widow or widower and a child or children, there shall be paid to such widow or widower an annuity, beginning on the day on which such judicial official died, in an amount computed as provided in subsection (l) of this section, and there shall also be paid to or on behalf of each such child an immediate annuity equal to:

(I) 10 percent of the average annual salary determined under subsection (l)(1) of this section; or

(II) 20 percent of such average annual salary, divided by the number of children;

whichever is smallest; or

(iii) if such judicial official leaves no surviving widow or widower, but does leave a surviving child or children, there shall be paid to or on behalf of each such child an immediate annuity equal to:

(I) the amount of the annuity to which the judicial official's widow or widower would have been entitled under clause (i) of this paragraph, had such widow or widower survived the judicial official, divided by the number of children; or

(II) 20 percent of the average annual salary determined under subsection (l)(1) of this section; or

(III) 40 percent of such average annual salary amount, divided by the number of children;

whichever is smallest.

(2) An annuity payable to a widow or widower under clause (i) or (ii) of paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be terminated upon his or her death or remarriage before attaining age 55.

(3) An annuity payable to a child under this subsection shall terminate:

(A) if such child is receiving an annuity based upon his or her status under paragraph (5)(A) of subsection (a) of this section, on the last day of the month during which he or she becomes eighteen years of age;

(B) if such child is receiving an annuity based upon his or her status under paragraph (5)(B) of subsection (a) of this section, either (i) on the first day of July immediately following his or her twenty-second birthday or (ii) on the last day of the month during which he or she ceases to be a full-time student in accordance with paragraph (5)(B) of subsection (a) of this section, whichever occurs first: Provided, That if such child is rendered incapable of self-support because of a mental or physical disability incurred while receiving that annuity, that annuity shall not terminate, but shall continue without interruption and shall be deemed to have become, as of the date of disability, an annuity based upon his or her status under clause (ii) of paragraph (5)(C) of subsection (a) of this section;

(C) if such child is receiving an annuity based upon his or her status under paragraph (5)(C) of subsection (a) of this section, on the last day of the month during which he or she ceases to be incapable of self-support because of mental or physical disability; or

(D) on the last day of the month during which such child dies or marries.

(4) An annuity payable to a child or children under paragraph (1)(ii) of this subsection shall be recomputed and paid as provided in paragraph (1)(iii) of this subsection upon the death, but not upon the remarriage, of the widow or widower who is receiving an annuity under paragraph (1)(ii) of this subsection.

(5) In any case in which the annuity of a child is terminated, the annuity of each remaining child which is based upon the service of the same judicial official shall be recomputed and paid as though the child whose annuity has been terminated had not survived that judicial official.

(6) In the case of the survivor or survivors of a judicial official to whom paragraph (1)(B) applies, there shall be deducted from the annuities otherwise payable under this section an amount equal to the amount of salary deductions that would have been made if such deductions had been made for 18 months prior to the judicial official's death.

(i)(1) All questions of dependency and disability arising under this section shall be determined by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, subject to review only by the Judicial Conference of the United States, and the decision of the Judicial Conference of the United States shall be final and conclusive.
The Director may order or direct at any time such medical or other examinations as he deems necessary to determine the facts relative to the nature and degree of disability of any child who is an annuitant, or an applicant for an annuity, under this section, and may suspend or deny any such annuity for failure to submit to any such examination.

(2) The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall determine whether the killing of a judicial official was an assassination, subject to review only by the Judicial Conference of the United States.
The head of any Federal agency that investigates the killing of a judicial official shall provide information to the Director that would assist the Director in making such determination.

(j) In any case in which a payment under this section is to be made to a minor, or to a person mentally incompetent or under other legal disability, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, such payment may be made to the person who is constituted guardian or other fiduciary of such claimant by the laws of the State of residence of such claimant, or to any other person who is otherwise legally vested with the care of the claimant or of the claimant's estate, and need not be made directly to such claimant.
The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts may, at his or her discretion, determine whether such payment is made directly to such claimant or to such guardian, fiduciary, or other person legally vested with the care of such claimant or the claimant's estate.
Where no guardian or other fiduciary of such minor or such person under legal disability has been appointed under the laws of the State of residence of such claimant, the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall determine the person who is otherwise legally vested with the care of the claimant or of the claimant's estate.

(k) The years of service rendered by a judicial official which may be creditable in calculating the amount of an annuity for such judicial official's widow or widower under subsection (l) of this section shall include—

(1) those years during which such judicial official served in any of the offices designated in paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this section, including in the case of a Justice or judge of the United States those years during which he or she continued to hold office following retirement from regular active service under section 371 or subsection (a) of section 372 of this title;

(2) those years during which such judicial official served as a Senator, Representative, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner in Congress, prior to assuming the responsibilities of any of the offices designated in paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this section;

(3) those years during which such judicial official honorably served on active duty in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard of the United States, prior to assuming the responsibilities of any of the offices designated in paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this section: Provided, That those years of such military service for which credit has been allowed for the purposes of retirement or retired pay under any other provision of law shall not be included as allowable years of such service under this section;

(4) those years during which such judicial official served as an “employee”, as that term is defined in subsection (1) of section 8331 of title 5, prior to assuming the responsibilities of any of the offices designated in paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this section,1 and

(5) those years during which such judicial official had deductions withheld from his or her retirement salary in accordance with subsection (b)(1) or (2) of this section.

For the purposes of this subsection the term “years” shall mean full years and twelfth parts thereof, excluding from the aggregate any fractional part of a month which numbers less than fifteen full days and including, as one full month, any fractional part of a month which numbers fifteen full days or more.
Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted as waiving or canceling that reduction in the annuity of a widow or widower which is required by subsection (d) of this section due to the failure of a judicial official to make those deposits required by subsection (d) of this section.

(l) The annuity of a widow or widower of a judicial official shall be an amount equal to the sum of—

(1) 1.5 percent of the average annual salary, including retirement salary, which such judicial official received for serving in any of the offices designated in paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this section (i) during those three years of such service, or during those three years while receiving a retirement salary, in which his or her annual salary or retirement salary was greatest, or (ii) if such judicial official has so served less than three years, then during the total period of such service prior to his or her death, multiplied by the total of:

(A) the number of years of creditable service tabulated in accordance with paragraph (1) of subsection (k) of this section; plus

(B) the number of years of creditable service tabulated in accordance with paragraph (2) of subsection (k) of this section; plus

(C) the number of years of creditable service tabulated in accordance with paragraph (3) of subsection (k) of this section; plus

(D) the number of years during which the judicial official had deductions withheld from his or her retirement salary under subsection (b)(1) or (2) of this section; plus

(E) the number of years up to, but not exceeding, fifteen of creditable service tabulated in accordance with paragraph (4) of subsection (k) of this section,

plus:

(2) three-fourths of 1 percent of such average annual salary, multiplied by the number of years of any prior creditable service, as tabulated in accordance with subsection (k) of this section, not applied under paragraph (1) of this subsection;

except that such annuity shall not exceed an amount equal to 50 percent of such average annual salary, nor be less than an amount equal to 25 percent of such average annual salary.
Any annuity determined in accordance with the provisions of this subsection shall be reduced to the extent required by subsection (d) of this section, and by the amount of any annuity payable to a former spouse under subsection (t).

(m) Each time that an increase is made under section 8340(b) of title 5 in annuities paid under subchapter III of chapter 83 of such title, each annuity payable from the Judicial Survivors’ Annuities Fund shall be increased at the same time by the same percentage by which annuities are increased under that section.

(n) Each annuity authorized under this section shall accrue monthly and shall be due and payable in monthly installments on the first business day of the month following the month or other period for which the annuity shall have accrued.
No annuity authorized under this section shall be assignable, either in law or in equity, except as provided in subsections (s) and (t), or subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process.

(o)(1) In any case in which a judicial official dies while in office, or while receiving “retirement salary”, and;

(A) subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, before having completed eighteen months of civilian service, computed in accordance with subsection (k) of this section, during which the salary deductions provided by subsection (b) of this section or the deposit required by subsection (d) of this section have actually been made; or

(B) after having completed eighteen months of civilian service, computed in accordance with subsection (k) of this section, during which all such deductions or deposits have been made, but without a survivor or survivors who are entitled to receive the annuity benefits provided by subsection (h) or (t) of this section; or

(C) the rights of all persons entitled to receive the annuity benefits provided by subsection (h) or (t) of this section terminate before a valid claim therefor has been established;

the total amount credited to the individual account of that judicial official, established under subsection (e) of this section, with interest at 4 percent per annum to December 31, 1947, and at 3 percent per annum thereafter, compounded on December 31, of each year, to the date of that judicial official's death, shall be paid, upon the establishment of a valid claim therefor, to the person or persons surviving at the date title to the payment arises, in the following order of precedence:

First, to the beneficiary or beneficiaries whom that judicial official may have designated in a writing received by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts prior to his or her death;

Second, if there be no such beneficiary, to the widow or widower of such judicial official;

Third, if none of the above, to the child or children of such judicial official and the descendants of any deceased children by representation;

Fourth, if none of the above, to the parents of such judicial official or the survivor of them;

Fifth, if none of the above, to the duly appointed executor, executrix, administrator, or administratrix of the estate of such judicial official;

Sixth, if none of the above, to such other next of kin of such judicial official, as may be determined by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to be entitled to such payment, under the laws of the domicile of such judicial official, at the time of his or her death.

Such payment shall be a bar to recovery by any other person.
For the purposes of this subsection only, a determination that an individual is a widow, widower, or child of a judicial official may be made by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts without regard to the definitions of those terms contained in paragraphs (3), (4), and (5) of subsection (a) of this section.

(2) In cases in which a judicial official dies as a result of assassination and leaves a survivor or survivors who are entitled to receive the annuity benefits provided by subsection (h) or (t) of this section, paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection shall not apply.

(p) In any case in which all the annuities which are authorized by this section and based upon the service of a given official terminate before the aggregate amount of annuity payments received by the annuitant or annuitants equals the total amount credited to the individual account of such judicial official, established under subsection (e) of this section with interest at 4 percent per annum to December 31, 1947, and at 3 percent per annum thereafter, compounded on December 31, of each year, to the date of that judicial official's death, the difference between such total amount, with such interest, and such aggregate amount shall be paid, upon establishment of a valid claim therefor, in the order of precedence prescribed in subsection (o) of this section.

(q) Any accrued annuity benefits remaining unpaid upon the termination of an annuity, other than by the death of an annuitant, shall be paid to that annuitant.
Any accrued annuity benefits remaining unpaid upon the death of an annuitant shall be paid, upon the establishment of a valid claim therefor, in the following order of precedence:

First, to the duly appointed executor, executrix, administrator, or administratrix of the estate of such annuitant;

Second, if there is no such executor, executrix, administrator, or administratrix, payments shall be made, after the expiration of sixty days from the date of death of such annuitant, to such individual or individuals as may appear, in the judgment of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, to be legally entitled thereto, and such payment shall be a bar to recovery by any other individual.

(r) Nothing contained in this section shall be interpreted to prevent a widow or widower eligible for an annuity under this section from simultaneously receiving such an annuity while also receiving any other annuity to which such widow or widower may also be entitled under any other law without regard to this section: Provided, That service used in the computation of the annuity conferred by this section shall not also be credited in computing any such other annuity.

(s) A judicial official who has a former spouse may elect, under procedures prescribed by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, to provide a survivor annuity for such former spouse under subsection (t). An election under this subsection shall be made at the time of retirement, or, if later, within 2 years after the date on which the marriage of the former spouse to the judicial official is dissolved.
An election under this subsection—

(1) shall not be effective to the extent that it—

(A) conflicts with—

(i) any court order or decree referred to in subsection (t)(1), which was issued before the date of such election, or

(ii) any agreement referred to in such subsection which was entered into before such date; or

(B) would cause the total of survivor annuities payable under subsections (h) and (t) based on the service of the judicial official to exceed 55 percent of the average annual salary (as such term is used in subsection (l)) of such official; and

(2) shall not be effective, in the case of a judicial official who is then married, unless it is made with the spouse's written consent.

The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall provide by regulation that paragraph (2) of this subsection may be waived if the judicial official establishes to the satisfaction of the Director that the spouse's whereabouts cannot be determined, or that, due to exceptional circumstances, requiring the judicial official to seek the spouse's consent would otherwise be inappropriate.

(t)(1) Subject to paragraphs (2) through (4) of this subsection, a former spouse of a deceased judicial official is entitled to a survivor annuity under this section if and to the extent expressly provided for in an election under subsection (s), or in the terms of any decree of divorce or annulment or any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to such decree.

(2) The annuity payable to a former spouse under this subsection may not exceed the difference between—

(A) the maximum amount that would be payable as an annuity to a widow or widower under subsection (l), determined without taking into account any reduction of such annuity caused by payment of an annuity to a former spouse; and

(B) the amount of any annuity payable under this subsection to any other former spouse of the judicial official, based on an election previously made under subsection (s), or a court order previously issued.

(3) The commencement and termination of an annuity payable under this subsection shall be governed by the terms of the applicable order, decree, agreement, or election, as the case may be, except that any such annuity—

(A) shall not commence before—

(i) the day after the judicial official dies, or

(ii) the first day of the second month beginning after the date on which the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts receives written notice of the order, decree, agreement, or election, as the case may be, together with such additional information or documentation as the Director may prescribe,

whichever is later, and

(B) shall terminate no later than the last day of the month before the former spouse remarries before becoming 55 years of age or dies.

(4) For purposes of this section, a modification in a decree, order, agreement, or election referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not be effective—

(A) if such modification is made after the retirement of the judicial official concerned, and

(B) to the extent that such modification involves an annuity under this subsection.

(u) In the case of a judicial official who is assassinated, an annuity shall be paid under this section notwithstanding a survivor's eligibility for or receipt of benefits under chapter 81 of title 5, except that the annuity for which a surviving spouse is eligible under this section shall be reduced to the extent that the total benefits paid under this section and chapter 81 of title 5 for any year would exceed the current salary for that year of the office of the judicial official.

(v) Subject to the terms of a decree, court order, or agreement described in subsection (t)(1), if any judicial official ceases to be married after making the election under subsection (a), he or she may revoke such election in writing by notifying the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.
The judicial official shall also notify any spouse or former spouse of the application for revocation in accordance with such requirements as the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall by regulation prescribe.
The Director may provide under such regulations that the notification requirement may be waived with respect to a spouse or former spouse if the judicial official establishes to the satisfaction of the Director that the whereabouts of such spouse or former spouse cannot be determined.

(w) The Comptroller General of the United States shall, at the end of each 3-fiscal year period, determine whether the contributions by judicial officials under subsection (b) during that 3-year period accounted for 50 percent of the costs of the Judicial Survivors’ Annuities Fund and if not, then what adjustments in the contribution rates under subsection (b) should be made to achieve that 50 percent figure.
The Comptroller General shall report the results of each determination under this subsection to the Congress.

(I) subparagraph (A) shall not apply to such bankruptcy judge or magistrate beginning on the date such election takes effect, and

(II) shall be filed with the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.

Such an election, once it takes effect, shall be irrevocable.

(n) Lump-Sum Payments.—

(1) Eligibility.—(A) Subject to paragraph (2), an individual who serves as a bankruptcy judge or magistrate and—

(iv) will not become eligible to receive an annuity under this section within 31 days after filing the application;

is entitled to be paid the lump-sum credit.
Payment of the lump-sum credit voids all rights to an annuity under this section based on the service on which the lump-sum credit is based, until that individual resumes office as a bankruptcy judge or magistrate.

(B) Lump-sum benefits authorized by subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E) of this paragraph shall be paid to the person or persons surviving the bankruptcy judge or magistrate and alive on the date title to the payment arises, in the order of precedence set forth in subsection (o) of section 376 of this title, and in accordance with the last two sentences of that subsection.
For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term “judicial official” as used in subsection (o) of section 376 shall be deemed to mean “bankruptcy judge or magistrate”.

(C) If a bankruptcy judge or magistrate dies before receiving an annuity under this section, the lump-sum credit shall be paid.

(D) If all annuity rights under this section based on the service of a deceased bankruptcy judge or magistrate terminate before the total annuity paid equals the lump-sum credit, the difference shall be paid.

A payment under this subparagraph voids all rights to an annuity on which the payment is based.

(2) Spouses and former spouses.—(A) Payment of the lump-sum credit under paragraph (1)(A) or a payment under paragraph (1)(G)—

(i) may be made only if any current spouse and any former spouse of the bankruptcy judge or magistrate are notified of the bankruptcy judge's or magistrate's application; and

(ii) shall be subject to the terms of a court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation or any court or court approved property settlement agreement incident to such decree, if—

(I) the decree, order, or agreement expressly relates to any portion of the lump-sum credit or other payment involved; and

(II) payment of the lump-sum credit or other payment would extinguish entitlement of the bankruptcy judge's or magistrate's spouse or former spouse to any portion of an annuity under subsection (i).

(B) Notification of a spouse or former spouse under this paragraph shall be made in accordance with such requirements as the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall by regulation prescribe.

(C) The Director shall prescribe regulations under which this paragraph shall be applied in any case in which the Director receives two or more orders or decrees described in subparagraph (A).

but does not include interest—

(i) if the service covered thereby aggregates 1 year or less; or

(ii) for the fractional part of a month in the total service.

(o) Judicial Officers’ Retirement Fund.—

(1) Establishment.—There is established in the Treasury a fund which shall be known as the “Judicial Officers’ Retirement Fund”. The Fund is appropriated for the payment of annuities, refunds, and other payments under this section.

(2) Investment of fund.—The Secretary of the Treasury shall invest, in interest bearing securities of the United States, such currently available portions of the Judicial Officers’ Retirement Fund as are not immediately required for payments from the Fund.
The income derived from these investments constitutes a part of the Fund.

(3) Unfunded liability.—(A) There are authorized to be appropriated to the Judicial Officers’ Retirement Fund amounts required to reduce to zero the unfunded liability of the Fund.

(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term “unfunded liability” means the estimated excess, determined on an annual basis in accordance with the provisions of section 9503 of title 31, of the present value of all benefits payable from the Judicial Officers’ Retirement Fund over the sum of—

(i) the present value of deductions to be withheld under this section from the future basic pay of bankruptcy judges and magistrates; plus

(ii) the balance in the Fund as of the date the unfunded liability is determined.

Historical and Revision Notes

1948 Act

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §334 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §227, 36 Stat. 1154; Mar. 4, 1911, ch. 285, §1, 36 Stat. 1419; July 1, 1922, ch. 267, §3, 42 Stat. 816; June 12, 1926, ch. 568, 44 Stat. 736; Jan. 29, 1929, ch. 113, 45 Stat. 1143; Mar. 2, 1929, ch. 488, §1, 45 Stat. 1475; July 3, 1930, ch. 863, §1, 46 Stat. 1016; Feb. 23, 1931, ch. 276, §30, 46 Stat. 1214; May 17, 1932, ch. 190, 47 Stat. 158; June 30, 1932, ch. 314, §501, 47 Stat. 415; May 10, 1934, ch. 277, §512, 48 Stat. 758; Ex. Ord.
No. 6166, §§12, 14, June 10, 1933; June 7, 1934, ch. 426, 48 Stat. 926; May 27, 1936, ch. 463, §1, 49 Stat. 1380; June 20, 1936, ch. 630, §5, 49 Stat. 1549; June 25, 1936, ch. 804, 49 Stat. 1921).

Requirements for printing, binding, and issuing Supreme Court decisions “within eight months after said decisions have been rendered by the Supreme Court” and provision for distribution “within said period” were omitted.
The phrase “as soon as practicable after rendition” was made the time for publishing such decisions as more flexible and practicable.

The words “the United States Court for China” were omitted inasmuch as that court is no longer functioning.
The Secretary of State by an arrangement with China has relinquished the extraterritorial jurisdiction previously exercised by the United States in China.
The 1944 Legislative and Judiciary Appropriation Act approved June 28, 1943, made no appropriation for the United States Court for China.
Appropriations for other courts were made in title II of chapter 173 (57 Stat. 241). The last appropriation for the United States Court for China was in the act of July 2, 1942 (ch. 472, title IV, 56 Stat. 502).

The words “to the Secretary of War for the use of the proper courts and officers of the Philippine Islands, seven copies” were omitted in view of the independence of the Philippines, effective July 4, 1946.

The phrase “justice or judge of the United States” obviated repetition of names of courts. (See definitive section 451 of this title.)

Last sentence, fourth paragraph, of section 334 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., requiring that books should remain the property of the United States and should be preserved and turned over to successors in office, was omitted as covered by section 414 of this title.

A reference to the United States attorney for the District of Columbia was omitted as covered by “each United States attorney.”

Provision authorizing distribution of volumes under this section to each place where a court of appeals is held was added for purposes of uniformity.
See similar provision in section 413 of this title.

The revised section substitutes the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts in lieu of the Attorney General insofar as distribution of volumes to the judiciary is concerned.
This change is consistent with the duties of the former under section 601 et seq. of this title.

Provision of section 334 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., as to the custody, use and delivery to successors was omitted as obsolete on advice of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.

The limitation of 10 copies to the library of the Supreme Court and 6 copies to the marshal of the Supreme Court for use of the justices, was omitted and the provision for distribution in such number “specified by the Chief Justice of the United States” was substituted therefor.

Authority for making an appropriation to carry into effect the provisions of this section is contained in section 336 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Acts July 1, 1922, ch. 267, §5, 42 Stat. 818; May 29, 1926, ch. 425, §3, 44 Stat. 678 which is omitted, but not repealed, as unnecessary in this revision.

Changes were made in phraseology and arrangement.

1949 Act

Subsection (a) of this section substitutes, in section 411(a) of title 28, U.S.C., “Secretary of the Army” and “Department of the Army” for “Secretary of War” and “War Department,” in view of such redesignation by act of July 26, 1947 (ch. 343, title II, §205(a), 61 Stat. 501). It substitutes, in section 411(a), “Commissioner of Customs; Commandant of the Coast Guard” for “Chief of the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation,” in view of the abolishment of the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation, and the transfer of its functions to, and the division thereof between, the Commissioner of Customs and the Commandant of the Coast Guard, by 1946 Reorganization Plan No. 3, §§101–104, effective July 16, 1946 (11 F.R. 7875, 60 Stat. 1097).

It substitutes, in such section 411(a), “Director of the Bureau of Land Management” for “Commissioner of the General Land Office,” in view of section 403 of such plan which abolished the General Land Office and created the Bureau of Land Management, headed by a Director.
It inserts as new, in such section 411(a), references to the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Air Force, and Judge Advocate General of the Air Force, in view of the creation of the National Military Establishment, headed by the Secretary of Defense, and the establishment of the Department of the Air Force in 1947.

Subsection (b) of this section redesignates, in section 411(b) of title 28, U.S.C., the Secretary of War as “Secretary of the Army,” for the reasons stated above, and corrects a typographical error in the word “court-martial”.

Historical and Revision Notes

1948 Act

Based on section 1131 of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Internal Revenue Code, title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§337, 530 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §229, 36 Stat. 1155; Mar. 2, 1929, ch. 488, §1, 45 Stat. 1475; May 10, 1934, ch. 277, §512, 48 Stat. 758; June 7, 1934, ch. 426, 48 Stat. 926; June 25, 1936, ch. 804, 49 Stat. 1921; Feb. 10, 1939, ch. 2, §1131, 53 Stat. 163; May 14, 1940, ch. 189, title IV, 54 Stat. 210; July 2, 1942, ch. 472, title IV, 56 Stat. 504; June 28, 1943, ch. 173, title II, §201, 57 Stat. 243; June 26, 1944, ch. 277, §203, 58 Stat. 358; May 21, 1945, ch. 129, title IV, 59 Stat. 200; July 5, 1946, ch. 541, title IV, 60 Stat. 480.)

Section consolidates provisions of section 1131 of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to expenditures for “lawbooks” for the Tax Court of the United States, with sections 337 and 530 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to purchase and distribution of reporter and digest volumes.

Other provisions of section 1131 of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in section 604 of this title.

Provisions of section 530 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., limiting the price to be paid for volumes of the Federal Reporter and other similar reports were omitted after consultation with the Administrative Office of United States Courts as more properly covered by current appropriation acts.
Similar provisions relating to the Federal Digest and the United States Code Annotated were omitted as covered in current appropriation acts. (See Act June 29, 1944, ch. 286, title II, §212, 58 Stat. 361, 387.)

Provisions of said section 337 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that books are to remain United States property, so marked, and transmitted to successors in office of persons receiving them, were omitted as covered by section 414 of this title.

Similar provisions in said section 530 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in section 414 of this title.

Provision in section 337 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for distribution to the Court of Appeals and District Court for the District of Columbia was omitted as covered by the phrase “Each place where a circuit court of appeals or district court is regularly held.”

The revised section is extended to include the Customs Court as well as the Court of Claims and Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.
All judges receive the Supreme Court reports and digests under section 411 of this title.
Presumably the Congress did not intend to deny distribution of the Federal Reporter and digests to the Customs Court while providing for all other courts under said section 337.

The revised section provides for distribution of volumes to the judiciary by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. (See reviser's note under section 411 of this title.)

Similar publications are purchased by the Marshal of Supreme Court for the use of the Court. (See section 672(5) of this title.)

The provisions of section 337 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., requiring annual estimates and disbursement of moneys for the volumes under this section were omitted.
Such provisions are covered by appropriate sections of title 31, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Money and Finance.

Provision of section 337 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., as to custody, use, and delivery to successors was omitted as obsolete on advice of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.

Numerous changes were made in phraseology and superfluous language was omitted.

1949 Act

Subsection (a) of this section eliminates from section 413 of title 28, U.S.C., the provision for furnishing books to the Tax Court, which procures books under section 1131 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C., 1946 ed., §1131).

Subsection (b) of this section incorporates in section 413 of title 28, U.S.C., with changes in phraseology, the provisions of act of June 3, 1948 (ch. 400, title II, §204, 62 Stat. 321), which was not incorporated in title 18 when the revision was enacted.
As amended, section 413 is expanded to give like authority with respect to procurement of books to the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, as well as to the Attorney General, to prevent an obvious inconsistency.

§414. Transmittal of books to successors

All government publications and law books furnished to justices, judges, clerks of courts, and United States attorneys of the United States and its territories and possessions, and other officers of the United States or an agency thereof shall be transmitted to their successors in office.
All permanent or bound books and publications furnished under this chapter except those books furnished to the Library of Congress for international exchange shall remain the property of the United States and shall be marked plainly, “The Property of the United States”.

(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 906; Oct. 18, 1962, Pub. L. 87–845, §7, 76A Stat. 699.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on section 90 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees, section 530 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and section 92 of title 44, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Public Printing and Documents (Aug. 7, 1882, ch. 433, §1, 22 Stat. 336; Jan. 12, 1895, ch. 23, §74, 28 Stat. 620; June 20, 1936, ch. 630, §§11, 12, 49 Stat. 1552, 1553; May 14, 1940, ch. 189, title IV, 54 Stat. 210; June 28, 1941, ch. 258, title IV, 55 Stat. 301; July 2, 1942, ch. 472, title IV, 56 Stat. 504; June 28, 1943, ch. 173, title II, §201, 57 Stat. 243; June 26, 1944, ch. 277, §203, 58 Stat. 358; May 21, 1945, ch. 129, title IV, 59 Stat. 200; July 5, 1946, ch. 541, title IV, 60 Stat. 480).

Section consolidates section 90 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., providing that “statutes” shall be delivered to successors of United States attorneys and clerks and provisions of section 530 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., requiring that all lawbooks for judges and others shall be marked as property of the United States and shall be transmitted to their successors, with section 92 of title 44, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to transmittal of “Government publications.”

Words “All Government publications and lawbooks” and “furnished under this chapter” were used to cover “all statutes” and “The Federal Reporter and continuations thereto.”

Words “justices and judges of the United States” were substituted for “United States judges” in conformity with uniform use of the phrase to describe all members of the Federal judiciary.
Similar provisions in sections 334 and 377 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were therefore omitted as covered by this revised section.

Other provisions of said section 530 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted. (See reviser's note under section 413 of this title.)

The words “permanent or bound” were inserted in the last sentence of the revised section to obviate the wasteful practice under existing law of marking temporary pamphlets.

Changes were made in phraseology.

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§13 and 302 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§9, 189, 36 Stat. 1088, 1143; Mar. 2, 1929, ch. 488, §1, 45 Stat. 1475).

Sections 13 and 302 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., related only to district courts and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, and this section has been written to cover all other courts of the United States.

Other provisions of said section 302 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in sections 214, 456, and 604 of this title.

The phrase “always open” means “never closed” and signifies the time when a court can exercise its functions.
With respect to matters enumerated by statute or rule as to which the court is “always open,” there is no time when the court is without power to act. (Ex parte Branch, 63 Ala. 383, 387.)

Section 13 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., provided that “The district courts, as courts of admiralty and as courts of equity, shall be deemed always open * * *” for enumerated purposes, and that the judge “at chambers or in the clerk's office, and in vacation as well as in term,” may make orders and issue process.
The revised section omits all reference to the nature of the action or proceeding and enumeration of the acts which may be performed by the court.
This is in accord with Rules 45(c) and 56 of the new Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure which contain similar provisions with respect to criminal procedure both in the courts of appeals and in the district courts.

Rules 6(c) and 77(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure contain provisions similar to the second and first paragraphs, respectively, of this section with respect to civil actions in district courts.

So help me God.”

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§241, 372, and District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., §§11–203, 11–303 (R.S.D.C., §752, 18 Stat. pt. II, 90; Feb. 9, 1893, ch. 74, §3, 27 Stat. 435; Mar. 3, 1901, ch. 854, §223, 31 Stat. 1224; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§136, 137, 257, 36 Stat. 1135, 1161; Feb. 25, 1919, ch. 29, §4, 40 Stat. 1157).

This section consolidates sections 11–203 and 11–303 of District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., and section 372 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with that portion of section 241 of said title 28 providing that judges of the Court of Claims shall take an oath of office.
The remainder of said section 241 comprises sections 171 and 173 of this title.

The phrase “justice or judge of the United States” was substituted for “justices of the Supreme Court, the circuit judges, and the district judges” appearing in said section 372, in order to extend the provisions of this section to judges of the Court of Claims, Customs Court, and Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and to all judges of any court which may be created by enactment of Congress.
See definition in section 451 of this title.

The Attorney General has ruled that the expression “any judge of any court of the United States” applied to the Chief Justice and all judges of the Court of Claims. (21 Op. Atty.

(a) Any justice, judge, or magistrate of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.

(b) He shall also disqualify himself in the following circumstances:

(1) Where he has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party, or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding;

(2) Where in private practice he served as lawyer in the matter in controversy, or a lawyer with whom he previously practiced law served during such association as a lawyer concerning the matter, or the judge or such lawyer has been a material witness concerning it;

(3) Where he has served in governmental employment and in such capacity participated as counsel, adviser or material witness concerning the proceeding or expressed an opinion concerning the merits of the particular case in controversy;

(4) He knows that he, individually or as a fiduciary, or his spouse or minor child residing in his household, has a financial interest in the subject matter in controversy or in a party to the proceeding, or any other interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding;

(5) He or his spouse, or a person within the third degree of relationship to either of them, or the spouse of such a person:

(i) Is a party to the proceeding, or an officer, director, or trustee of a party;

(ii) Is acting as a lawyer in the proceeding;

(iii) Is known by the judge to have an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding;

(iv) Is to the judge's knowledge likely to be a material witness in the proceeding.

(c) A judge should inform himself about his personal and fiduciary financial interests, and make a reasonable effort to inform himself about the personal financial interests of his spouse and minor children residing in his household.

(d) For the purposes of this section the following words or phrases shall have the meaning indicated:

(1) “proceeding” includes pretrial, trial, appellate review, or other stages of litigation;

(2) the degree of relationship is calculated according to the civil law system;

(3) “fiduciary” includes such relationships as executor, administrator, trustee, and guardian;

(4) “financial interest” means ownership of a legal or equitable interest, however small, or a relationship as director, adviser, or other active participant in the affairs of a party, except that:

(i) Ownership in a mutual or common investment fund that holds securities is not a “financial interest” in such securities unless the judge participates in the management of the fund;

(ii) An office in an educational, religious, charitable, fraternal, or civic organization is not a “financial interest” in securities held by the organization;

(iii) The proprietary interest of a policyholder in a mutual insurance company, of a depositor in a mutual savings association, or a similar proprietary interest, is a “financial interest” in the organization only if the outcome of the proceeding could substantially affect the value of the interest;

(iv) Ownership of government securities is a “financial interest” in the issuer only if the outcome of the proceeding could substantially affect the value of the securities.

(e) No justice, judge, or magistrate shall accept from the parties to the proceeding a waiver of any ground for disqualification enumerated in subsection (b). Where the ground for disqualification arises only under subsection (a), waiver may be accepted provided it is preceded by a full disclosure on the record of the basis for disqualification.

(f) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this section, if any justice, judge, magistrate, or bankruptcy judge to whom a matter has been assigned would be disqualified, after substantial judicial time has been devoted to the matter, because of the appearance or discovery, after the matter was assigned to him or her, that he or she individually or as a fiduciary, or his or her spouse or minor child residing in his or her household, has a financial interest in a party (other than an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome), disqualification is not required if the justice, judge, magistrate, bankruptcy judge, spouse or minor child, as the case may be, divests himself or herself of the interest that provides the grounds for the disqualification.

(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 908; Dec. 5, 1974, Pub. L. 93–512, §1, 88 Stat. 1609; Nov. 6, 1978, Pub. L. 95–598, title II, §214(a), (b), 92 Stat. 2661; Nov. 19, 1988, Pub. L. 100–702, title X, §1007, 102 Stat. 4667.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §24 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §20, 36 Stat. 1090).

Section 24 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., applied only to district judges.
The revised section is made applicable to all justices and judges of the United States.

The phrase “in which he has a substantial interest” was substituted for “concerned in interest in any suit.”

The provision of section 24 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., as to giving notice of disqualification to the “senior circuit judge,” and words “and thereupon such proceedings shall be had as are provided in sections 17 and 18 of this title,” were omitted as unnecessary and covered by section 291 et seq. of this title relating to designation and assignment of judges.
Such provision is not made by statute in case of disqualification or incapacity, for other cause.
See sections 140, 143, and 144 of this title.
If a judge or clerk of court is remiss in failing to notify the chief judge of the district or circuit, the judicial council of the circuit has ample power under section 332 of this title to apply a remedy.

Relationship to a party's attorney is included in the revised section as a basis of disqualification in conformity with the views of judges cognizant of the grave possibility of undesirable consequences resulting from a less inclusive rule.

Changes were made in phraseology.

Change of Name

Reference to United States magistrate or to magistrate deemed to refer to United States magistrate judge pursuant to section 321 of Pub. L. 101–650, set out as a note under section 631 of this title.

Such places shall be designated by the respective courts except when otherwise directed by the judicial council of the circuit.

Papers of any court established by Act of Congress which have become obsolete and are no longer necessary or useful, may be disposed of with the approval of the court concerned in the manner provided by sections 366–380 of Title 44 and in accordance with the rules of the Judicial Conference of the United States.

(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 908; Nov. 6, 1978, Pub. L. 95–598, title II, §216, 92 Stat. 2661.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§10, 523a, 523b, (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §6, 36 Stat. 1088; June 3, 1930, ch. 396, §§1, 2, 46 Stat. 496).

Section consolidates and simplifies sections 10, 523a and 523b of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to filing district court records and destroying obsolete papers and bankruptcy proofs of claims.

The revised section enlarges scope of section 10 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., to include places of keeping records of courts of appeals which was not covered by existing law.

The provisions in section 10 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that where court is held “at more than one place” and the place of keeping the records “is not specially provided by law, they shall be kept at either of the places” designated by the court, was changed to permit the judicial councils of the circuits to make the determination without requiring special enactment of Congress.
See section 332 of this title as to purpose and duties of the judicial councils.

The provision of section 523a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., authorizing destruction of records by the Attorney General was rewritten in the second paragraph to give such authority, respecting court records, to the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.
Such Director, under section 604 of this title, now exercises administrative authority over clerks and commissioners.

A similar provision with respect to records of United States attorneys and marshals was omitted as superseded by sections 366 and 380 of title 44, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Public Printing and Documents, which prescribe the exclusive method for disposition of such papers.

The provision of section 385 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., giving to “all courts of the United States” power to impose and administer all necessary oaths is the only part of such section in this title.
The remainder is incorporated in section 401 of revised title 18, U.S.C. (H.R. 1600, 80th Cong.), Crimes and Criminal Procedure.

The revised section clarifies what was apparently a statutory omission in that no provision was made with reference to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, the judges of which now will have the same power respecting administering oaths as judges of other courts.

§471. Requirement for a district court civil justice expense and delay reduction plan

There shall be implemented by each United States district court, in accordance with this chapter, a civil justice expense and delay reduction plan.
The plan may be a plan developed by such district court or a model plan developed by the Judicial Conference of the United States.
The purposes of each plan are to facilitate deliberate adjudication of civil cases on the merits, monitor discovery, improve litigation management, and ensure just, speedy, and inexpensive resolutions of civil disputes.

(Added Pub. L. 101–650, title I, §103(a), Dec. 1, 1990, 104 Stat. 5090; amended Pub. L. 102–198, §2(1), Dec. 9, 1991, 105 Stat. 1623.)

Congressional Statement of Findings

Section 102 of Pub. L. 101–650 provided that: “The Congress makes the following findings:

“(1) The problems of cost and delay in civil litigation in any United States district court must be addressed in the context of the full range of demands made on the district court's resources by both civil and criminal matters.

“(2) The courts, the litigants, the litigants’ attorneys, and the Congress and the executive branch, share responsibility for cost and delay in civil litigation and its impact on access to the courts, adjudication of cases on the merits, and the ability of the civil justice system to provide proper and timely judicial relief for aggrieved parties.

“(3) The solutions to problems of cost and delay must include significant contributions by the courts, the litigants, the litigants’ attorneys, and by the Congress and the executive branch.

“(4) In identifying, developing, and implementing solutions to problems of cost and delay in civil litigation, it is necessary to achieve a method of consultation so that individual judicial officers, litigants, and litigants’ attorneys who have developed techniques for litigation management and cost and delay reduction can effectively and promptly communicate those techniques to all participants in the civil justice system.

“(5) Evidence suggests that an effective litigation management and cost and delay reduction program should incorporate several interrelated principles, including—

“(A) the differential treatment of cases that provides for individualized and specific management according to their needs, complexity, duration, and probable litigation careers;

“(B) early involvement of a judicial officer in planning the progress of a case, controlling the discovery process, and scheduling hearings, trials, and other litigation events;

“(C) regular communication between a judicial officer and attorneys during the pretrial process; and

“(D) utilization of alternative dispute resolution programs in appropriate cases.

“(6) Because the increasing volume and complexity of civil and criminal cases imposes increasingly heavy workload burdens on judicial officers, clerks of court, and other court personnel, it is necessary to create an effective administrative structure to ensure ongoing consultation and communication regarding effective litigation management and cost and delay reduction principles and techniques.”

Implementation of Plans

Section 103(b), (c) of Pub. L. 101–650, as amended by Pub. L. 102–572, title V, §505, Oct. 29, 1992, 106 Stat. 4513, provided that:

“(2) The requirements set forth in sections 471 through 478 of title 28, United States Code, as added by subsection (a), shall remain in effect for seven years after the date of the enactment of this title.

“(c) Early Implementation District Courts.—

“(1) Any United States district court that, no earlier than June 30, 1991, and no later than December 31, 1991, develops and implements a civil justice expense and delay reduction plan under chapter 23 of title 28, United States Code, as added by subsection (a), shall be designated by the Judicial Conference of the United States as an Early Implementation District Court.

“(2) The chief judge of a district so designated may apply to the Judicial Conference for additional resources, including technological and personnel support and information systems, necessary to implement its civil justice expense and delay reduction plan.
The Judicial Conference may provide such resources out of funds appropriated pursuant to section 106(a) [Pub. L. 101–650, title I, Dec. 1, 1990, 104 Stat. 5098].

“(3) Within 18 months after the date of the enactment of this title [Dec. 1, 1990], the Judicial Conference shall prepare a report on the plans developed and implemented by the Early Implementation District Courts.

“(4) The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall transmit to the United States district courts and to the Committees on the Judiciary of the Senate and House of Representatives—

“(A) copies of the plans developed and implemented by the Early Implementation District Courts;

“(B) summaries of the reports submitted by such district courts pursuant to section 472(d) of title 28, United States Code, as added by subsection (a); and

“(C) the report prepared in accordance with paragraph (3) of this subsection.”

Demonstration Program

“(2) A district court participating in the demonstration program may also be an Early Implementation District Court under section 103(c) [set out above].

“(b) Program Requirement.—(1) The United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan and the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio shall experiment with systems of differentiated case management that provide specifically for the assignment of cases to appropriate processing tracks that operate under distinct and explicit rules, procedures, and timeframes for the completion of discovery and for trial.

“(2) The United States District Court for the Northern District of California, the United States District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia, and the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri shall experiment with various methods of reducing cost and delay in civil litigation, including alternative dispute resolution, that such district courts and the Judicial Conference of the United States shall select.

“(c) Study of Results.—The Judicial Conference of the United States, in consultation with the Director of the Federal Judicial Center and the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, shall study the experience of the district courts under the demonstration program.

“(d) Report.—Not later than December 31, 1996, the Judicial Conference of the United States shall transmit to the Committees on the Judiciary of the Senate and the House of Representatives a report of the results of the demonstration program.”

“(2) A district court participating in the pilot program shall be designated as an Early Implementation District Court under section 103(c) [set out above].

“(b) Program Requirements.—(1) Ten district courts (in this section referred to as ‘Pilot Districts’) designated by the Judicial Conference of the United States shall implement expense and delay reduction plans under chapter 23 of title 28, United States Code (as added by section 103(a)), not later than December 31, 1991. In addition to complying with all other applicable provisions of chapter 23 of title 28, United States Code (as added by section 103(a)), the expense and delay reduction plans implemented by the Pilot Districts shall include the 6 principles and guidelines of litigation management and cost and delay reduction identified in section 473(a) of title 28, United States Code.

(B) identify trends in case filings and in the demands being placed on the court's resources;

(C) identify the principal causes of cost and delay in civil litigation, giving consideration to such potential causes as court procedures and the ways in which litigants and their attorneys approach and conduct litigation; and

(2) In developing its recommendations, the advisory group of a district court shall take into account the particular needs and circumstances of the district court, litigants in such court, and the litigants’ attorneys.

(3) The advisory group of a district court shall ensure that its recommended actions include significant contributions to be made by the court, the litigants, and the litigants’ attorneys toward reducing cost and delay and thereby facilitating access to the courts.

§473. Content of civil justice expense and delay reduction plans

(a) In formulating the provisions of its civil justice expense and delay reduction plan, each United States district court, in consultation with an advisory group appointed under section 478 of this title, shall consider and may include the following principles and guidelines of litigation management and cost and delay reduction:

(1) systematic, differential treatment of civil cases that tailors the level of individualized and case specific management to such criteria as case complexity, the amount of time reasonably needed to prepare the case for trial, and the judicial and other resources required and available for the preparation and disposition of the case;

(2) early and ongoing control of the pretrial process through involvement of a judicial officer in—

(A) assessing and planning the progress of a case;

(B) setting early, firm trial dates, such that the trial is scheduled to occur within eighteen months after the filing of the complaint, unless a judicial officer certifies that—

(i) the demands of the case and its complexity make such a trial date incompatible with serving the ends of justice; or

(ii) the trial cannot reasonably be held within such time because of the complexity of the case or the number or complexity of pending criminal cases;

(C) controlling the extent of discovery and the time for completion of discovery, and ensuring compliance with appropriate requested discovery in a timely fashion; and

(D) setting, at the earliest practicable time, deadlines for filing motions and a time framework for their disposition;

(3) for all cases that the court or an individual judicial officer determines are complex and any other appropriate cases, careful and deliberate monitoring through a discovery-case management conference or a series of such conferences at which the presiding judicial officer—

(A) explores the parties’ receptivity to, and the propriety of, settlement or proceeding with the litigation;

(B) identifies or formulates the principal issues in contention and, in appropriate cases, provides for the staged resolution or bifurcation of issues for trial consistent with Rule 42(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure;

(C) prepares a discovery schedule and plan consistent with any presumptive time limits that a district court may set for the completion of discovery and with any procedures a district court may develop to—

(i) identify and limit the volume of discovery available to avoid unnecessary or unduly burdensome or expensive discovery; and

(ii) phase discovery into two or more stages; and

(D) sets, at the earliest practicable time, deadlines for filing motions and a time framework for their disposition;

(4) encouragement of cost-effective discovery through voluntary exchange of information among litigants and their attorneys and through the use of cooperative discovery devices;

(5) conservation of judicial resources by prohibiting the consideration of discovery motions unless accompanied by a certification that the moving party has made a reasonable and good faith effort to reach agreement with opposing counsel on the matters set forth in the motion; and

(6) authorization to refer appropriate cases to alternative dispute resolution programs that—

(A) have been designated for use in a district court; or

(B) the court may make available, including mediation, minitrial, and summary jury trial.

(b) In formulating the provisions of its civil justice expense and delay reduction plan, each United States district court, in consultation with an advisory group appointed under section 478 of this title, shall consider and may include the following litigation management and cost and delay reduction techniques:

(1) a requirement that counsel for each party to a case jointly present a discovery-case management plan for the case at the initial pretrial conference, or explain the reasons for their failure to do so;

(2) a requirement that each party be represented at each pretrial conference by an attorney who has the authority to bind that party regarding all matters previously identified by the court for discussion at the conference and all reasonably related matters;

(3) a requirement that all requests for extensions of deadlines for completion of discovery or for postponement of the trial be signed by the attorney and the party making the request;

(4) a neutral evaluation program for the presentation of the legal and factual basis of a case to a neutral court representative selected by the court at a nonbinding conference conducted early in the litigation;

(5) a requirement that, upon notice by the court, representatives of the parties with authority to bind them in settlement discussions be present or available by telephone during any settlement conference; and

(6) such other features as the district court considers appropriate after considering the recommendations of the advisory group referred to in section 472(a) of this title.

(c) Nothing in a civil justice expense and delay reduction plan relating to the settlement authority provisions of this section shall alter or conflict with the authority of the Attorney General to conduct litigation on behalf of the United States, or any delegation of the Attorney General.

The title of the position was changed to “Assistant Attorney General for Administration” by §307 of the Act of Aug. 14, 1964, Pub. L. 88–426, 78 Stat. 432.

The words “competitive service” are substituted for “classified civil service” because the term “classified civil service” formerly used to designate the merit system established by the Civil Service Act of 1883 has become ambiguous due to the creation of the “classified” pay system.
The term “competitive service” is now customarily used, and appears throughout title 5, United States Code, in place of “classified civil service”.

The words “There shall be in the Department of Justice” are omitted as unnecessary as the title of the position and the fact of appointment by the Attorney General establish the location of the position in the Department of Justice.

The last 12 words of section 5 of the Reorganization Plan are omitted on authority of the Act of June 5, 1952, ch. 369, §1101 (3d proviso), 66 Stat. 121. The salary of the position is now fixed by §303(e) of the Act of Aug. 14, 1964, Pub. L. 88–426, 78 Stat. 420, which is codified in section 5316 of title 5, United States Code.

Message of the President

To the Congress of the United States:

In my first Reorganization Plan of 1968, I call for the creation of a new and powerful Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs.

With this action, America will serve notice to the pusher and the peddler that their criminal acts must stop.

No matter how well organized they are, we will be better organized.
No matter how well they have concealed their activities, we will root them out.

Today, Federal investigation and enforcement of our narcotics laws are fragmented.
One major element—the Bureau of Narcotics—is in the Treasury Department and responsible for the control of marihuana and narcotics such as heroin.
Another—the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control—is in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and is responsible for the control of dangerous drugs including depressants, stimulants, and hallucinogens such as LSD.

Neither is located in the agency which is primarily concerned with Federal law enforcement—the Department of Justice.

This separation of responsibilities—despite the relentless and dedicated efforts of the agents of each Bureau—has complicated and hindered our response to a national menace.

For example, more than nine out of ten seizures of LSD made by the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control have also turned up marihuana—but that Bureau has no jurisdiction over marihuana.

In many instances, we are confronted by well organized disciplined and resourceful criminals who reap huge profits at the expense of their unfortunate victims.

The response of the Federal Government must be unified.
And it must be total.

Today, in my Message on Crime, I recommended strong new laws to control dangerous drugs.
I also recommended an increase of more than thirty percent in the number of Federal agents enforcing the narcotic and dangerous drug laws.

I now propose that a single Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs be established in the Department of Justice to administer those laws and to bring to the American people the most efficient and effective Federal enforcement machinery we can devise.

Under this Reorganization Plan the Attorney General will have full authority and responsibility for enforcing the Federal laws relating to narcotics and dangerous drugs.
The new Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, to be headed by a Director appointed by the Attorney General, will:

—consolidate the authority and preserve the experience and manpower of the Bureau of Narcotics and the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control.

—work with states and local governments in their crackdown on illegal trade in drugs and narcotics, and help to train local agents and investigators.

—maintain worldwide operations, working closely with other nations, to suppress the trade in illicit narcotics and marihuana.

—conduct an extensive campaign of research and a nationwide public education program on drug abuse and its tragic effects.

The Plan I forward today moves in the direction recommended by two distinguished groups:

—1949 Hoover Commission.

—the 1963 Presidential Advisory Commission on Narcotic and Drug Abuse.

This Administration and this Congress have the will and the determination to stop the illicit traffic in drugs.

But we need more than the will and the determination.
We need a modern and efficient instrument of Government to transform our plans into action.
That is what this Reorganization Plan calls for.

The Plan has been prepared in accordance with chapter 9 of title 5 of the United States Code.

I have found, after investigation, that each reorganization included in the plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 901(a) of title 5 of the United States Code.

I have also found that, by reason of these reorganizations, it is necessary to include in the accompanying plan provisions for the appointment and compensation of the five new positions as specified in section 3 of the plan.
The rates of compensation fixed for these new positions are those which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable positions in the Executive Branch of the Government.

Should the reorganization I propose take effect, they will make possible more effective and efficient administration of Federal law enforcement functions.
It is not practicable at this time, however, to itemize the reduction in expenditures which may result.

I recommend that the Congress allow this urgently needed and important Reorganization Plan to become effective.

Lyndon B. Johnson.

Message of the President

To the Congress of the United States:

Drug abuse is one of the most vicious and corrosive forces attacking the foundations of American society today.
It is a major cause of crime and a merciless destroyer of human lives.
We must fight it with all of the resources at our command.

This Administration has declared all-out, global war on the drug menace.
As I reported to the Congress earlier this month in my State of the Union message, there is evidence of significant progress on a number of fronts in that war.

Both the rate of new addiction to heroin and the number of narcotic-related deaths showed an encouraging downturn last year.
More drug addicts and abusers are in treatment and rehabilitation programs than ever before.

Progress in pinching off the supply of illicit drugs was evident in last year's stepped-up volume of drug seizures worldwide—which more than doubled in 1972 over the 1971 level.

Arrests of traffickers have risen by more than one-third since 1971. Prompt Congressional action on my proposal for mandatory minimum sentences for pushers of hard drugs will help ensure that convictions stemming from such arrests lead to actual imprisonment of the guilty.

Notwithstanding these gains, much more must be done.
The resilience of the international drug trade remains grimly impressive—current estimates suggest that we still intercept only a small fraction of all the heroin and cocaine entering this country.
Local police still find that more than one of every three suspects arrested for street crimes is a narcotic abuser or addict.
And the total number of Americans addicted to narcotics, suffering terribly themselves and inflicting their suffering in countless others, still stands in the hundreds of thousands.

A UNIFIED COMMAND FOR DRUG ENFORCEMENT

Seeking ways to intensify our counter-offensive against this menace, I am asking the Congress today to join with this Administration in strengthening and streamlining the Federal drug law enforcement effort.

Funding for this effort has increased sevenfold during the past five years, from $36 million in fiscal year 1969 to $257 million in fiscal year 1974—more money is not the most pressing enforcement need at present.
Nor is there a primary need for more manpower working on the problem, over 2100 new agents having already been added to the Federal drug enforcement agencies under this Administration, an increase of more than 250 percent over the 1969 level.

The enforcement work could benefit significantly, however, from consolidation of our anti-drug forces under a single unified command.
Right now the Federal Government is fighting the war on drug abuse under a distinct handicap, for its efforts are those of a loosely confederated alliance facing a resourceful, elusive, worldwide enemy.
Admiral Mahan, the master naval strategist, described this handicap precisely when he wrote that “Granting the same aggregate of force, it is never as great in two hands as in one, because it is not perfectly concentrated.”

More specifically, the drug law enforcement activities of the United States now are not merely in two hands but in half a dozen.
Within the Department of Justice, with no overall direction below the level of the Attorney General, these fragmented forces include the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, the Office for Drug Abuse Law Enforcement, the Office of National Narcotics Intelligence, and certain activities of the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration.
The Treasury Department is also heavily engaged in enforcement work through the Bureau of Customs.

This aggregation of Federal activities has grown up rapidly over the past few years in response to the urgent need for stronger anti-drug measures.
It has enabled us to make a very encouraging beginning in the accelerated drug enforcement drive of this Administration.

But it also has serious operational and organizational shortcomings.
Certainly the cold-blooded underworld networks that funnel narcotics from suppliers all over the world into the veins of American drug victims are no respecters of the bureaucratic dividing lines that now complicate our anti-drug efforts.
On the contrary, these modern-day slave traders can derive only advantage from the limitations of the existing organizational patchwork.
Experience has now given us a good basis for correcting those limitations, and it is time to do so.

I therefore propose creation of a single, comprehensive Federal agency within the Department of Justice to lead the war against illicit drug traffic.

Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973, which I am transmitting to the Congress with this message, would establish such an agency, to be called the Drug Enforcement Administration.
It would be headed by an Administrator reporting directly to the Attorney General.

The Drug Enforcement Administration would carry out the following anti-drug functions, and would absorb the associated manpower and budgets:

—All functions of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (which would be abolished as a separate entity by the reorganization plan);

—Those functions of the Bureau of Customs pertaining to drug investigations and intelligence (to be transferred from the Treasury Department to the Attorney General by the reorganization plan).

—All functions of the Office of Drug Abuse Law Enforcement; and

—All functions of the Office of National Narcotics Intelligence.

Merger of the latter two organizations into the new agency would be effected by an executive order dissolving them and transferring their functions, to take effect upon approval of Reorganization Plan No. 2 by the Congress.
Drug law enforcement research currently funded by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration and other agencies would also be transferred to the new agency by executive action.

The major responsibility of the Drug Enforcement Administration would thus include:

—development of overall Federal drug law enforcement strategy, programs, planning, and evaluation;

—full investigation and preparation for prosecution of suspects for violations under all Federal drug trafficking laws;

—full investigation and preparation for prosecution of suspects connected with illicit drugs seized at U.S. ports-of-entry and international borders;

—conduct of all relations with drug law enforcement officials of foreign governments, under the policy guidance of the Cabinet Committee on International Narcotics Control;

—full coordination and cooperation with State and local law enforcement officials on joint drug enforcement efforts; and

—regulation of the legal manufacture of drugs and other controlled substances under Federal regulations.

The Attorney General, working closely with the Administrator of this new agency, would have authority to make needed program adjustments.
He would take steps within the Department of Justice to ensure that high priority emphasis is placed on the prosecution and sentencing of drug traffickers following their apprehension by the enforcement organization.
He would also have the authority and responsibility for securing the fullest possible cooperation-particularly with respect to collection of drug intelligence—from all Federal departments and agencies which can contribute to the anti-drug work, including the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

My proposals would make possible a more effective antidrug role for the FBI, especially in dealing with the relationship between drug trafficking and organized crime.
I intend to see that the resources of the FBI are fully committed to assist in supporting the new Drug Enforcement Administration.

The consolidation effected under Reorganization Plan No. 2 would reinforce the basic law enforcement and criminal justice mission of the Department of Justice.
With worldwide drug law enforcement responsibilities no longer divided among several organizations in two different Cabinet departments, more complete and cumulative drug law enforcement intelligence could be compiled.
Patterns of international and domestic illicit drug production, distribution, and sale could be more directly compared and interpreted.
Case-by-case drug law enforcement activities could be more comprehensively linked, cross-referenced, and coordinated into a single, organic enforcement operation.
In short, drug law enforcement officers would be able to spend more time going after the traffickers and less time coordinating with one another.

Such progress could be especially helpful on the international front.
Narcotics control action plans, developed under the leadership of the Cabinet Committee on International Narcotics Control, are now being carried out by U.S. officials in cooperation with host governments in 59 countries around the world.
This wide-ranging effort to cut off drug supplies before they ever reach U.S. borders or streets is just now beginning to bear fruit.
We can enhance its effectiveness, with little disruption of ongoing enforcement activities, by merging both the highly effective narcotics force of overseas Customs agents and the rapidly developing international activities of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs into the Drug Enforcement Administration.
The new agency would work closely with the Cabinet Committee under the active leadership of the U.S. Ambassador in each country where anti-drug programs are underway.

Two years ago, when I established the Special Action Office for Drug Abuse Prevention within the Executive Office of the President, we gained an organization with the necessary resources, breadth, and leadership capacity to begin dealing decisively with the “demand” side of the drug abuse problem—treatment and rehabilitation for those who have been drug victims, and preventive programs for potential drug abusers.
This year, by permitting my reorganization proposals to take effect, the Congress can help provide a similar capability on the “supply” side.
The proposed Drug Enforcement Administration, working as a team with the Special Action Office, would arm Americans with a potent one-two punch to help us fight back against the deadly menace of drug abuse.
I ask full Congressional cooperation in its establishment.

IMPROVING PORT-OF-ENTRY INSPECTIONS

No heroin or cocaine is produced within the United States; domestic availability of these substances results solely from their illegal importation.
The careful and complete inspection of all persons and goods coming into the United States is therefore an integral part of effective Federal drug law enforcement.

At the present time, however, Federal responsibility for conducting port-of-entry inspections is awkwardly divided among several Cabinet departments.
The principal agencies involved are the Treasury Department's Bureau of Customs, which inspects goods, and the Justice Department's Immigration and Naturalization Service, which inspects persons and their papers.
The two utilize separate inspection procedures, hold differing views of inspection priorities, and employ dissimilar personnel management practices.

To reduce the possibility that illicit drugs will escape detection at ports-of-entry because of divided responsibility, and to enhance the effectiveness of the Drug Enforcement Administration, the reorganization plan which I am proposing today would transfer to the Secretary of the Treasury all functions currently vested in Justice Department officials to inspect persons, or the documents of persons.

When the plan takes effect, it is my intention to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to use the resources so transferred—including some 1,000 employees of the Immigration and Naturalization Service—to augment the staff and budget of the Bureau of Customs.
The Bureau's primary responsibilities would then include:

—inspection of all persons and goods entering the United States;

—valuation of goods being imported, and assessment of appropriate tariff duties;

—interception of contraband being smuggled into the United States;

—enforcement of U.S. laws governing the international movement of goods, except the investigation of contraband drugs and narcotics; and

—turning over the investigation responsibility for all drug law enforcement cases to the Department of Justice.

The reorganization would thus group most port-of-entry inspection functions in a single Cabinet department.
It would reduce the need for much day-to-day interdepartmental coordination, allow more efficient staffing at some field locations, and remove the basis for damaging interagency rivalries.
It would also give the Secretary of the Treasury the authority and flexibility to meet changing requirements in inspecting the international flow of people and goods.
An important by-product of the change would be more convenient service for travellers entering and leaving the country.

For these reasons, I am convinced that inspection activities at U.S. ports-of-entry can more effectively support our drug law enforcement efforts if concentrated in a single agency.
The processing of persons at ports-of-entry is too closely interrelated with the inspection of goods to remain organizationally separated from it any longer.
Both types of inspections have numerous objectives besides drug law enforcement, so it is logical to vest them in the Treasury Department, which has long had the principal responsibility for port-of-entry inspection of goods, including goods being transported in connection with persons.
As long as the inspections are conducted with full awareness of related drug concerns it is neither necessary nor desirable that they be made a responsibility of the primary drug enforcement organization.

DECLARATIONS

After investigation, I have found that each action included in Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in Section 901(a) of Title 5 of the United States Code.
In particular, the plan is responsive of the intention of the Congress as expressed in Section 901(a)(1): “to promote better execution of the laws, more effective management of the executive branch and of its agencies and functions, and expeditious administration of the public business;” Section 901(a)(3): “to increase the efficiency of the operations of the Government to the fullest extent practicable;” Section 901(a)(5) “to reduce the number of agencies by consolidating those having similar functions under a single head, and to abolish such agencies or functions as may not be necessary for the efficient conduct of the Government;” and Section 901(a)(6): “to eliminate overlapping and duplication of effort.”

As required by law, the plan has one logically consistent subject matter: consolidation of Federal drug law enforcement activities in a manner designed to increase their effectiveness.

The plan would establish in the Department of Justice a new Administration designated as the Drug Enforcement Administration.
The reorganizations provided for in the plan make necessary the appointment and compensation of new officers as specified in Section 5 of the plan.
The rates of compensation fixed for these officers would be comparable to those fixed for officers in the executive branch who have similar responsibilities.

While it is not practicable to specify all of the expenditure reductions and other economies which may result from the actions proposed, some savings may be anticipated in administrative costs now associated with the functions being transferred and consolidated.

The proposed reorganization is a necessary step in upgrading the effectiveness of our Nation's drug law enforcement effort.
Both of the proposed changes would build on the strengths of established agencies, yielding maximum gains in the battle against drug abuse with minimum loss of time and momentum in the transition.

I am confident that this reorganization plan would significantly increase the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the Federal Government.
I urge the Congress to allow it to become effective.

1–5. Access to Legal Opinions

1–501. In addition to the disclosure now required by law, all agencies are encouraged to make available for public inspection and copying other opinions of their legal officers that are statements of policy or interpretation that have been adopted by the agency, unless the agency determines that disclosure would result in demonstrable harm.

The Department of War was designated the Department of the Army by the Act of July 26, 1947, ch. 343, §205, 61 Stat. 501. “Department of the Air Force” is added on authority of the Act of July 26, 1947, ch. 343, §207(a), (f), 61 Stat. 502. The word “Secretary” is substituted for “head.” The words “military department” are substituted for “department” to conform to section 102 of title 5, United States Code, and section 101 of title 10, United States Code.
The words “for disposition” are substituted for “to be by him referred to the proper officer in his department, or otherwise disposed of as he may deem proper.”

Sections 187 and 364 of the Revised Statutes are combined into one section since they both deal with the same subject matter and are derived from the Act of Feb. 14, 1871, ch. 51, §3, 16 Stat. 412.

The words “executive department” are substituted for “Department” because “Department”, as used in R.S. §§187 and 364, meant “executive department”. (See R.S. §159.) The word “agency” is substituted for “bureau” as it has a more common current acceptance.
The word “concerning” is substituted for “touching”. Reference to application for a subpena is omitted as R.S. §364 gives the department head the same authority to request aid from the Attorney General whether or not application has been made for a subpena.

Section 187 of the Revised Statutes was part of title IV of the Revised Statutes.
The Act of July 26, 1947, ch. 343, §201(d), as added Aug. 10, 1949, ch. 412, §4, 63 Stat. 579 (former 5 U.S.C. 171–1), which provides “Except to the extent inconsistent with the provisions of this Act [National Security Act of 1947], the provisions of title IV of the Revised Statutes as now or hereafter amended shall be applicable to the Department of Defense” is omitted from this title but is not repealed.

Minor changes are made in phraseology to allow for the combining of the two sections.

§515. Authority for legal proceedings; commission, oath, and salary for special attorneys

(a) The Attorney General or any other officer of the Department of Justice, or any attorney specially appointed by the Attorney General under law, may, when specifically directed by the Attorney General, conduct any kind of legal proceeding, civil or criminal, including grand jury proceedings and proceedings before committing magistrates, which United States attorneys are authorized by law to conduct, whether or not he is a resident of the district in which the proceeding is brought.

(b) Each attorney specially retained under authority of the Department of Justice shall be commissioned as special assistant to the Attorney General or special attorney, and shall take the oath required by law.
Foreign counsel employed in special cases are not required to take the oath.
The Attorney General shall fix the annual salary of a special assistant or special attorney at not more than $12,000.

The words “as such officer” are omitted as unnecessary since it is implied that the officer is a party in his official capacity as an officer.

Ord.
No. 12988, §12, Feb. 5, 1996, 61 F.R. 4734, set out below.

Ex. Ord.
No. 12988. Civil Justice Reform

Ex. Ord.
No. 12988, Feb. 5, 1996, 61 F.R. 4729, provided:

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and in order to improve access to justice for all persons who wish to avail themselves of court and administrative adjudicatory tribunals to resolve disputes, to facilitate the just and efficient resolution of civil claims involving the United States Government, to encourage the filing of only meritorious civil claims, to improve legislative and regulatory drafting to reduce needless litigation, to promote fair and prompt adjudication before administrative tribunals, and to provide a model for similar reforms of litigation practices in the private sector and in various states, it is hereby ordered as follows:

Section 1. Guidelines to Promote Just and Efficient Government Civil Litigation.
To promote the just and efficient resolution of civil claims, those Federal agencies and litigation counsel that conduct or otherwise participate in civil litigation on behalf of the United States Government in Federal court shall respect and adhere to the following guidelines during the conduct of such litigation:

(a) Pre-filing Notice of a Complaint.
No litigation counsel shall file a complaint initiating civil litigation without first making a reasonable effort to notify all disputants about the nature of the dispute and to attempt to achieve a settlement, or confirming that the referring agency that previously handled the dispute has made a reasonable effort to notify the disputants and to achieve a settlement or has used its conciliation processes.

(b) Settlement Conferences.
As soon as practicable after ascertaining the nature of a dispute in litigation, and throughout the litigation, litigation counsel shall evaluate settlement possibilities and make reasonable efforts to settle the litigation.
Such efforts shall include offering to participate in a settlement conference or moving the court for a conference pursuant to Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [28 App. U.S.C.] in an attempt to resolve the dispute without additional civil litigation.

(c) Alternative Methods of Resolving the Dispute in Litigation.
Litigation counsel shall make reasonable attempts to resolve a dispute expeditiously and properly before proceeding to trial.

(1) Whenever feasible, claims should be resolved through informal discussions, negotiations, and settlements rather than through utilization of any formal court proceeding.
Where the benefits of Alternative Dispute Resolution (“ADR”) may be derived, and after consultation with the agency referring the matter, litigation counsel should suggest the use of an appropriate ADR technique to the parties.

(2) It is appropriate to use ADR techniques or processes to resolve claims of or against the United States or its agencies, after litigation counsel determines that the use of a particular technique is warranted in the context of a particular claim or claims, and that such use will materially contribute to the prompt, fair, and efficient resolution of the claims.

(3) To facilitate broader and effective use of informal and formal ADR methods, litigation counsel should be trained in ADR techniques.

(d) Discovery.
To the extent practical, litigation counsel shall make every reasonable effort to streamline and expedite discovery in cases under counsel's supervision and control.

(1) Review of Proposed Document Requests.
Each agency within the executive branch shall establish a coordinated procedure for the conduct and review of document discovery undertaken in litigation directly by that agency when that agency is litigation counsel.
The procedure shall include, but is not necessarily limited to, review by a senior lawyer prior to service or filing of the request in litigation to determine that the request is not cumulative or duplicative, unreasonable, oppressive, unduly burdensome or expensive, taking into account the requirements of the litigation, the amount in controversy, the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation, and whether the documents can be obtained from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive.

(2) Discovery Motions.
Before petitioning a court to resolve a discovery motion or petitioning a court to impose sanctions for discovery abuses, litigation counsel shall attempt to resolve the dispute with opposing counsel.
If litigation counsel makes a discovery motion concerning the dispute, he or she shall represent in that motion that any attempt at resolution was unsuccessful or impracticable under the circumstances.

(e) Sanctions.
Litigation counsel shall take steps to seek sanctions against opposing counsel and opposing parties where appropriate.

(1) Litigation counsel shall evaluate filings made by opposing parties and, where appropriate, shall petition the court to impose sanctions against those responsible for abusive practices.

(2) Prior to filing a motion for sanctions, litigation counsel shall submit the motion for review to the sanctions officer, or his or her designee, within the litigation counsel's agency.
Such officer or designee shall be a senior supervising attorney within the agency, and shall be licensed to practice law before a State court, courts of the District of Columbia, or courts of any territory or Commonwealth of the United States.
The sanctions officer or designee shall also review motions for sanctions that are filed against litigation counsel, the United States, its agencies, or its officers.

(f) Improved Use of Litigation Resources.
Litigation counsel shall employ efficient case management techniques and shall make reasonable efforts to expedite civil litigation in cases under that counsel's supervision and control.
This includes but is not limited to:

(1) making reasonable efforts to negotiate with other parties about, and stipulate to, facts that are not in dispute;

(2) reviewing and revising pleadings and other filings to ensure that they are accurate and that they reflect a narrowing of issues, if any, that has resulted from discovery;

(3) requesting early trial dates where practicable;

(4) moving for summary judgment in every case where the movant would be likely to prevail, or where the motion is likely to narrow the issues to be tried; and

(5) reviewing and revising pleadings and other filings to ensure that unmeritorious threshold defenses and jurisdictional arguments, resulting in unnecessary delay, are not raised.

Sec. 2. Government Pro Bono and Volunteer Service.
All Federal agencies should develop appropriate programs to encourage and facilitate pro bono legal and other volunteer service by government employees to be performed on their own time, including attorneys, as permitted by statute, regulation, or other rule or guideline.

Sec. 3. Principles to Enact Legislation and Promulgate Regulations Which Do Not Unduly Burden the Federal Court System. 

(a) General Duty to Review Legislation and Regulations.
Within current budgetary constraints and existing executive branch coordination mechanisms and procedures established in OMB Circular A-19 and Executive Order No. 12866 [5 U.S.C. 601 note], each agency promulgating new regulations, reviewing existing regulations, developing legislative proposals concerning regulations, and developing new legislation shall adhere to the following requirements:

(1) The agency's proposed legislation and regulations shall be reviewed by the agency to eliminate drafting errors and ambiguity;

(2) The agency's proposed legislation and regulations shall be written to minimize litigation; and

(3) The agency's proposed legislation and regulations shall provide a clear legal standard for affected conduct rather than a general standard, and shall promote simplification and burden reduction.

(b) Specific Issues for Review.
In conducting the reviews required by subsection (a), each agency formulating proposed legislation and regulations shall make every reasonable effort to ensure:

(1) that the legislation, as appropriate—

(A) specifies whether all causes of action arising under the law are subject to statutes of limitations;

(B) specifies in clear language the preemptive effect, if any, to be given to the law;

(C) specifies in clear language the effect on existing Federal law, if any, including all provisions repealed, circumscribed, displaced, impaired, or modified;

(D) provides a clear legal standard for affected conduct;

(E) specifies whether private arbitration and other forms of private dispute resolution are appropriate under enforcement and relief provisions; subject to constitutional requirements;

(F) specifies whether the provisions of the law are severable if one or more of them is found to be unconstitutional;

(G) specifies in clear language the retroactive effect, if any, to be given to the law;

(H) specifies in clear language the applicable burdens of proof;

(I) specifies in clear language whether it grants private parties a right to sue and, if so, the relief available and the conditions and terms for authorized awards of attorney's fees, if any;

(J) specifies whether State courts have jurisdiction under the law and, if so, whether and under what conditions an action would be removable to Federal court;

(K) specifies whether administrative proceedings are to be required before parties may file suit in court and, if so, describes those proceedings and requires the exhaustion of administrative remedies;

(L) sets forth the standards governing the assertion of personal jurisdiction, if any;

(M) defines key statutory terms, either explicitly or by reference to other statutes that explicitly define those terms;

(N) specifies whether the legislation applies to the Federal Government or its agencies;

(O) specifies whether the legislation applies to States, territories, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealths of Puerto Rico and of the Northern Mariana Islands;

(P) specifies what remedies are available such as money damages, civil penalties, injunctive relief, and attorney's fees; and

(Q) addresses other important issues affecting clarity and general draftsmanship of legislation set forth by the Attorney General, with the concurrence of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) and after consultation with affected agencies, that are determined to be in accordance with the purposes of this order.

(2) that the regulation, as appropriate—

(A) specifies in clear language the preemptive effect, if any, to be given to the regulation;

(B) specifies in clear language the effect on existing Federal law or regulation, if any, including all provisions repealed, circumscribed, displaced, impaired, or modified;

(C) provides a clear legal standard for affected conduct rather than a general standard, while promoting simplification and burden reduction;

(D) specifies in clear language the retroactive effect, if any, to be given to the regulation;

(E) specifies whether administrative proceedings are to be required before parties may file suit in court and, if so, describes those proceedings and requires the exhaustion of administrative remedies;

(F) defines key terms, either explicitly or by reference to other regulations or statutes that explicitly define those items; and

(G) addresses other important issues affecting clarity and general draftsmanship of regulations set forth by the Attorney General, with the concurrence of the Director of OMB and after consultation with affected agencies, that are determined to be in accordance with the purposes of this order.

(c) Agency Review.
The agencies shall review such draft legislation or regulation to determine that either the draft legislation or regulation meets the applicable standards provided in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, or it is unreasonable to require the particular piece of draft legislation or regulation to meet one or more of those standards.

Sec. 4. Principles to Promote Just and Efficient Administrative Adjudications.

(a) Implementation of Administrative Conference Recommendations.
In order to promote just and efficient resolution of disputes, an agency that adjudicates administrative claims shall, to the extent reasonable and practicable, and when not in conflict with other sections of this order, implement the recommendations of the Administrative Conference of the United States, entitled “Case Management as a Tool for Improving Agency Adjudication,” as contained in 1 C.F.R. 305.86-7 (1991).

(b) Improvements in Administrative Adjudication.
All Federal agencies should review their administrative adjudicatory processes and develop specific procedures to reduce delay in decision-making, to facilitate self-representation where appropriate, to expand non-lawyer counseling and representation where appropriate, and to invest maximum discretion in fact-finding officers to encourage appropriate settlement of claims as early as possible.

(c) Bias.
All Federal agencies should review their administrative adjudicatory processes to identify any type of bias on the part of the decision-makers that results in an injustice to persons who appear before administrative adjudicatory tribunals; regularly train all fact-finders, administrative law judges, and other decision-makers to eliminate such bias; and establish appropriate mechanisms to receive and resolve complaints of such bias from persons who appear before administrative adjudicatory tribunals.

(d) Public Education.
All Federal agencies should develop effective and simple methods, including the use of electronic technology, to educate the public about its claims/benefits policies and procedures.

Sec. 5. Coordination by the Department of Justice.

(a) The Attorney General shall coordinate efforts by Federal agencies to implement sections 1, 2 and 4 of this order.

(b) To implement the principles and purposes announced by this order, the Attorney General is authorized to issue guidelines implementing sections 1 and 4 of this order for the Department of Justice.
Such guidelines shall serve as models for internal guidelines that may be issued by other agencies pursuant to this order.

Sec. 6. Definitions.
For purposes of this order:

(a) The term “agency” shall be defined as that term is defined in section 105 of title 5, United States Code.

(b) The term “litigation counsel” shall be defined as the trial counsel or the office in which such trial counsel is employed, such as the United States Attorney's Office for the district in which the litigation is pending or a litigating division of the Department of Justice.
Special Assistant United States Attorneys are included within this definition.
Those agencies authorized by law to represent themselves in court without assistance from the Department of Justice are also included in this definition, as are private counsel hired by any Federal agency to conduct litigation on behalf of the agency or the United States.

Sec. 7. No Private Rights Created.

		5 U.S.C. 91.	R.S. §188.

The section is reorganized and restated for clarity.

In subsection (a), the word “concerning” is substituted for “touching”.

In subsection (b), the words “without delay” are omitted as unnecessary in view of the requirement that the statement be furnished “Within a reasonable time”. The word “briefly” is substituted for “succinctly”. The words “in suit” are omitted as unnecessary.

The words “executive department” are substituted for “department” because “department” as used in R.S. §188 meant “executive department”. (See R.S. §159.) The words “military department” are inserted to preserve the application of the source law.
Before enactment of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 578), the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force were Executive departments.
The National Security Act Amendments of 1949 established the Department of Defense as an Executive Department including the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force as military departments, not as Executive departments.
However, the source law for this section, which was in effect in 1949, remained applicable to the Secretaries of the military departments by virtue of section 12(g) of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 591), which is set out in the reviser's note for section 301 of title 5, United States Code.

§521. Publication and distribution of opinions

The Attorney General, from time to time—

(1) shall cause to be edited, and printed in the Government Printing Office, such of his opinions as he considers valuable for preservation in volumes; and

(2) may prescribe the manner for the distribution of the volumes.

Each volume shall contain headnotes, an index, and such footnotes as the Attorney General may approve.

Section 188 of the Revised Statutes was part of title IV of the Revised Statutes.

The words “his opinions” are substituted for “the opinions of the law officers herein authorized to be given” as the opinions of the Attorney General are his and only his and the reference to other “law officers” is misleading.
All functions of all other officers of the Department of Justice were transferred to the Attorney General by 1950 Reorg.

The words “pertaining to the Department that he considers proper” are substituted for “appertaining thereto that he may deem proper”.

The words “and a detailed statement of the amounts used for defraying the expenses of the United States courts in each judicial district” are omitted as obsolete in view of the creation of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts by the Act of Aug. 7, 1939, ch. 501, §1, 53 Stat. 1223 (Chapter 41 of this title).

In paragraph (3), the words “involving the United States” are inserted for clarity.

(Added Pub. L. 89–554, §4(c), Sept. 6, 1966, 80 Stat. 616.)

Historical and Revision Notes

The section is supplied for convenience and clarification.
The Bureau of Investigation in the Department of Justice, the earliest predecessor agency of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, was created administratively in 1908. It appears that funds used for the Bureau of Investigation were first obtained through the Department of Justice Appropriation Act of May 22, 1908, ch. 186, §1 (par. beginning “From the appropriations for the prosecution of crimes”), 35 Stat. 236, although that statutory provision makes no express mention of the Bureau or of the investigative function.

Section 3 of Executive Order No. 6166 of June 10, 1933, specifically recognized the Bureau of Investigation in the Department of Justice and provided that all that Bureau's functions together with the investigative functions of the Bureau of Prohibition were “transferred to and consolidated in a Division of Investigation in the Department of Justice, at the head of which shall be a Director of Investigation.”

The Division of Investigation was first designated as the “Federal Bureau of Investigation” by the Act of Mar. 22, 1935, ch. 39, title II, 49 Stat. 77, and has been so designated in statutes since that date.

§532. Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation

The Attorney General may appoint a Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
The Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is the head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

(Added Pub. L. 89–554, §4(c), Sept. 6, 1966, 80 Stat. 616.)

Historical and Revision Notes

The section is supplied for convenience and clarification and is based on section 3 of Executive Order No. 6166 of June 10, 1933, which provided for the transfer of the functions of the Bureau of Investigation together with the investigative functions of the Bureau of Prohibition to a “Division of Investigation in the Department of Justice, at the head of which shall be a Director of Investigation”. The Division of Investigation was first designated as the “Federal Bureau of Investigation” by the Act of Mar. 22, 1935, ch. 39, title II, 49 Stat. 77, and has been so designated in statutes since that date.
The title of “Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation” was recognized by statute in the Act of June 5, 1936, ch. 529, 49 Stat. 1484, and has been used in statutes since that date.

FBI Critical Skills Scholarship Program

“(c) Availability of Funds.—Any payment made by the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to carry out any program proposed to be established under subsection (a) may be made in any fiscal year only to the extent that appropriated funds are available for that purpose.”

Confirmation and Compensation of Director; Term of Service

Pub. L. 90–351, title VI, §1101, June 19, 1968, 82 Stat. 236, as amended by Pub. L. 94–503, title II, §203, Oct. 15, 1976, 90 Stat. 2427, provided that:

“(a) Effective as of the day following the date on which the present incumbent in the office of Director ceases to serve as such, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and shall receive compensation at the rate prescribed for level II of the Federal Executive Salary Schedule [section 5313 of Title 5, Government Organization and Employees].

“(b) Effective with respect to any individual appointment by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, after June 1, 1973, the term of service of the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall be ten years.
A Director may not serve more than one ten-year term.
The provisions of subsections (a) through (c) of section 8335 of title 5, United States Code, shall apply to any individual appointed under this section.”

The section is from the Department of Justice Appropriation Act, 1965. Similar provisions were contained in each appropriation Act for the Department running back to 1921, which Acts are identified in a note under sections 299 and 300 of title 5, U.S.C. 1964 ed.

The section is reorganized for clarity.
The authority to appoint officials for the cited purposes is implied.
The word “may” is substituted for “is authorized to”. The words “who shall be vested with the authority necessary for the execution of such duties” are omitted as unnecessary as the appointment of the officials for the purposes indicated carries with it the authority necessary to perform their duties.

In paragraph (2), the words “to assist in” are added for clarity and in recognition of the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 3056 which vest in the United States Secret Service the responsibility for the protection of the person of the President.
As so revised, this paragraph will assure that the Secret Service will continue to have primary responsibility for the protection of the President but at the same time will permit the Federal Bureau of Investigation to render assistance in such protection.

The last sentence is added because in various areas the authority to investigate certain criminal offenses has been specifically assigned by statute to departments and agencies other than the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
For example, the enforcement of the internal revenue laws is specifically a function of the Secretary of the Treasury and he is authorized to employ such number of persons as he deems proper for the enforcement of such laws (26 U.S.C. 7801, 7803). The Secretary of the Treasury is specifically authorized to direct the collection of duties on imports and to appoint such employees for that purpose as he deems necessary (19 U.S.C. 3, 6). The U.S. Coast Guard is specifically authorized to enforce or assist in enforcing the Federal laws upon the high seas and waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States (14 U.S.C. 2). Subject to the direction of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secret Service is specifically authorized to detect and arrest persons committing offenses against the laws of the United States relating to coins and obligations and securities of the United States and foreign governments (18 U.S.C. 3056).

The section is revised and restated to eliminate ambiguity and give true effect to the prohibition against the use of appropriations to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
The language used to define the excepted status of the positions, officers, and employees is based on revised sections 2102 and 2103 of title 5, United States Code.

The provisions of this section were made permanent by the Act of July 28, 1950, 64 Stat. 380. Identical provisions appearing in former section 300d of title 5 are derived from the Department of Justice Appropriation Act, 1965, and earlier appropriation Acts for the Department of Justice running back to 1942, which Acts are identified in a note under former section 300d of title 5, U.S.C. 1964 ed.

Prior section 501.—Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §481, sections 643 and 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions, and section 11–1001, District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed.

Section consolidates section 481 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and section 11–1001 of the District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., with parts of sections 643 and 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to appointment of United States attorneys.

The term “United States attorney” was adopted in this section for “attorney for the United States.” Since the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in In re Neagle, 1890 (10 S. Ct. 658, 135 U.S. 1, 34, L. Ed. 55) where the terms “attorneys of the United States” and “district attorneys” were used interchangeably, Congress has also designated such officers as either “United States attorneys” or as “district attorneys.” See Acts of Feb. 22, 1886, ch. 928, §7, 24 Stat. 309; July 3, 1890, ch. 656, §16, 26 Stat. 217; July 10, 1890, ch. 664, §16, 26 Stat. 225, and Acts of July 20, 1882, ch. 312, §3, 22 Stat. 172; Mar. 3, 1915, ch. 100, §3, 38 Stat. 961; May 28, 1926, ch. 414, §2(b), 44 Stat. 672.

At present, such officers are invariably designated as “United States attorneys” by Federal courts and the Department of Justice.

Words “The President may appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,” were inserted to conform section with the Constitution.
See article II, section 2, clause 2.

Words “including the District of Columbia” were omitted, because the District is made a judicial district by section 88 of this title.
District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., §11–1001, provided for appointment of an “attorney of the United States for the District” by the President, subject to Senate confirmation.

Words “learned in the law” were omitted as unnecessary.
Such requirement is not made of United States judges and no reason appears to make a distinction respecting United States attorneys.

Parts of section 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., remain in said title 48. For remainder thereof, see Distribution Table.
Other provisions of section 643 of such title are incorporated in sections 133, 504 [now 541 and 544], and 541 [see 561] of this title.

Changes were made in phraseology.

Section consolidates sections 483 and 594 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to appointment of assistant United States attorneys.

Words “United States attorneys” were substituted for “district attorneys.” (See reviser's note under section 501 [now 541] of this title.)

The exception of Alaska from the operation of such section 483 was omitted as covered by section 109 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions, authorizing appointment of assistant United States attorneys in Alaska.

Reference in such section 483 to “District of Columbia” was omitted. (See reviser's note under section 501 [now 541] of this title.)

The provisions of sections 483 and 594 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., requiring the judges and United States attorneys to certify or evidence in writing the necessity for assistant United States attorneys in their respective districts, and specifying that such opinion of the judge shall state to the Attorney General the facts as distinguished from conclusions, showing the necessity therefor, were omitted.
The Attorney General, as chief law enforcement officer, is in a better position to determine such necessity.

The salary provisions of such section 594 were omitted as covered by section 508 [now 548] of this title.

Changes were made in phraseology.

Prior section 504.—Based on section 315 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees, title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §482, and sections 643 and 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions (R.S. §§366, 769; June 24, 1898, ch. 495, §1, 30 Stat. 487; Apr. 12, 1900, ch. 191, §34, 31 Stat. 85; Apr. 30, 1900, ch. 339, §86, 31 Stat. 158; Mar. 3, 1909, ch. 269, §1, 35 Stat. 838; Jan. 7, 1913, ch. 6, 37 Stat. 648; Mar. 2, 1917, ch. 145, §41, 39 Stat. 965; Mar. 4, 1921, ch. 161, §1, 41 Stat. 1412; July 9, 1921, ch. 42, §313, 42 Stat. 119; Feb. 12, 1925, ch. 220, 43 Stat. 890; Apr. 17, 1930, ch. 174, 46 Stat. 170; Mar. 26, 1938, ch. 51, §2, 52 Stat. 118).

Section consolidates parts of sections 315 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and 643 and 863 of title 48, both U.S.C., 1940 ed., with section 482 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
It is recommended that said section 315 be amended so as to omit those provisions relating to special attorneys to assist “district attorneys” which were used as part of the basis for this section, as other parts of said section 315, relating to special assistants to the Attorney General, and to foreign counsel, are to remain in title 5.

Words “United States attorney” were substituted for district attorney, and reference to District of Columbia was omitted. (See reviser's note under section 501 [now 541] of this title.)

Reference to the territories in said section 482, was also omitted as covered by provisions of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions.
See sections 109 and 112 of such title applicable to United States attorney in Alaska, and 1353 applicable in the Canal Zone, and 1405y applicable in the Virgin Islands.

The provision as to the tenure of the assistant United States attorneys and special attorneys is new.
Existing law contains no provision as to tenure or removal of such officials.
While the Supreme Court has held that the power of removal of executive officials is incident to the power of appointment, this section expressly provides for removal.
See Meyers v. United States, 1926 (47 S.Ct. 21, 272 U.S. 52, 71 L.Ed. 160).

Said section 315 contained a provision that special attorneys appointed to assist United States attorneys should take the same oath required of the latter.
This section was extended to assistant United States attorneys, respecting whom no provision existed as to oaths.

A portion of section 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., is retained in said title 48. For remainder of said section 863, see Distribution Table.
Other provisions of section 643 of such title are incorporated in sections 133, 501 [now 541], and 541 [see 561] of this title.

§545. Residence

(a) Each United States attorney shall reside in the district for which he is appointed, except that these officers of the District of Columbia, the Southern District of New York, and the Eastern District of New York may reside within 20 miles thereof.
Each assistant United States attorney shall reside in the district for which he or she is appointed or within 25 miles thereof.
The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any United States attorney or assistant United States attorney appointed for the Northern Mariana Islands who at the same time is serving in the same capacity in another district.

1948 Act

Prior section 505.—Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §524 (June 20, 1874, ch. 328, §2, 18 Stat. 109; May 28, 1896, ch. 252, §§8, 12, 29 Stat. 181, 183; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §291, 36 Stat. 1167; June 14, 1941, ch. 203, §§1, 2, 55 Stat. 251).

The provisions of section 524 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the United States attorney shall give his personal attention to the duties of his office and declaring the office of United States attorney vacant upon his removal from his district or neglect of duty, were omitted as unnecessary and inconsistent with section 507(b) [now 519] of this title, charging the Attorney General with the duty of supervising the United States attorneys in the performance of their duties.

The provision permitting the United States attorney and his assistants to reside within twenty miles of the District of Columbia was added because of the relatively small and congested area of the District, as a result of which few Federal officers are appointed from the District or reside therein.
Also the residence requirement of this section has no relation to domicile or voting residence nor does it affect the citizenship or residence status of District of Columbia officeholders in the several States from which appointed.

Only citizens of Hawaii resident therein at least 3 years preceding appointment may be appointed as United States Attorneys for the district of Hawaii.
See section 501 [now 541] of this title.

§546. Vacancies

(a) Except as provided in subsection (b), the Attorney General may appoint a United States attorney for the district in which the office of United States attorney is vacant.

(b) The Attorney General shall not appoint as United States attorney a person to whose appointment by the President to that office the Senate refused to give advice and consent.

(c) A person appointed as United States attorney under this section may serve until the earlier of—

(1) the qualification of a United States attorney for such district appointed by the President under section 541 of this title; or

(2) the expiration of 120 days after appointment by the Attorney General under this section.

(d) If an appointment expires under subsection (c)(2), the district court for such district may appoint a United States attorney to serve until the vacancy is filled.
The order of appointment by the court shall be filed with the clerk of the court.

Words “United States attorney” were substituted for “district attorney.” (See Reviser's Note under section 501 [now 541] of this title.)

Words “The Supreme Court of the Territory, and the district court of the United States for the District of Columbia” were omitted as obsolete.
This section, as revised, applies to all districts enumerated in chapter 5 of this title.
There were no provisions respecting vacancies in Hawaii and Puerto Rico.
Therefore this section remedies this situation and establishes a uniform method to fill interim vacancies.

Words “and a copy shall be entered on the journal of the court” after “filed in the clerk's office of said court”, in section 511 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as unnecessary.

(4) institute and prosecute proceedings for the collection of fines, penalties, and forfeitures incurred for violation of any revenue law, unless satisfied on investigation that justice does not require the proceedings; and

(5) make such reports as the Attorney General may direct.

Prior section 507.—Based on sections 312, 317, 323, 324, 327, 329, 330, 331 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees; second paragraph of section 305e of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians; and title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§485, 486, 487, 488, 489 (R.S. §§362, 363, 373, 374, 377, 379–381, 771–775, 838; Feb. 27, 1877, ch. 69, §1, 19 Stat. 241; Apr. 9, 1910, ch. 152, 36 Stat. 294; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §291, 36 Stat. 1167; May 10, 1934, ch. 277, §512, 48 Stat. 758; Aug. 27, 1935, ch. 748, §6, 49 Stat. 893).

This section consolidates provisions of the sections enumerated above.

Other provisions of section 312 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in sections 503 [now 543] and 508 [now 548] of this title.

All requirements in said sections for reports to officers other than the Attorney General are omitted as unnecessary and are simplified in subsection (a)(5) of this section.
The Attorney General directs the course of litigation in government cases and makes appropriate rules for furnishing information promptly to the Departments interested.

Specific duties fixed by sections 485—489 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and the second paragraph of section 305e of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., to prosecute and defend both civil and criminal proceedings, are covered in subsections (a)(1)–(4) of this section.

Use of “revenue law” in subsection (a)(4) in this section, which is based on section 486 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., obviates repetition of provisions relating to customs and revenue laws as both are covered by the term.
For discussion of this point, see reviser's note under section 3283 in House Report 152, to accompany H.R. 1600 Eightieth Congress, for revision of the Criminal Code.

The following sections of said title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are superseded by, covered by, or inconsistent with subsection (a)(2)(5) of this section, subsection (b) of this section [now section 519 of this title], and section 5 of Executive Order No. 6166 of June 10, 1933, transferring to the Department of Justice the function of supervising the work of United States attorneys in connection with suits by or against the United States exercised by any agency or officer:

Section 323 requiring the General Counsel of the Treasury to make entries of bonds delivered to United States attorneys by collectors for suit until the amounts have been paid or judgments secured;

Section 324 requiring said General Counsel to examine and compare the reports made by collectors of bonds delivered by them to United States attorneys for suit, and of the returns of such bonds;

Section 329 authorizing said General Counsel to instruct United States attorneys, marshals and clerks in all matters relating to suits, except for taxes, forfeitures and penalties, and to require them to make such reports to him as he may direct.
The first provision of section 329 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., is covered by the last paragraph of this section [now section 519 of this title], under which the Attorney General exercises supervision of the duties of United States attorneys.
The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts supervises the duties of clerks under chapter 41 of this title.
The provision for authority of said General Counsel over marshals, also contained in section 329, is incorporated in section 547 [see Prior Provisions note below] of this title in which such authority is vested in the Attorney General.

Section 327 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., authorized said General Counsel to establish regulations, subject to approval by the Attorney General, to be observed by United States attorneys and marshals in which the United States is a party.
The provision as to United States attorneys is also covered by the last paragraph of this section [now section 519 of this title], and that as to marshals is covered by section 547 [see Prior Provisions note below] of this title.

Provisions of section 327 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to establishment of regulations for the observance of collectors of the customs, by the General Counsel for the Department of the Treasury, with the approbation of the Secretary of the Treasury, was omitted and recommended for repeal as covered by section 66 of title 19, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Customs Duties.

The last paragraph of this section [now section 519 of this title], is based on the first clause of section 317 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed.; see also section 309 of title 5. The second clause of said section 317 is covered by subsection (a)(5) of this section.
The authority of the Attorney General over marshals and the requirement that they shall report to him the conduct and state of their offices, contained also in said section 317, is incorporated in section 547 [see Prior Provisions note below] of this title.

Section 330 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which required that United States attorneys should conduct, under direction of the General Counsel of the Treasury, all suits and proceedings involving the United States under the laws governing national banking associations is covered by subsection (a)(2) of this section.

Section 331 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., requiring United States attorneys to obey directions of the Department of Justice in suits for money due the Post Office Department, is covered also by subsection (a)(2) of this section.

Changes in arrangement and phraseology were made.

The words “sections 5315–5317 of title 5” are substituted for “subsection (f) and (g) of section 303 of the Federal Executive Salary Act of 1964” to reflect the codification of those subsections in title 5. The words “GS–18 of the General Schedule set forth in section 5332 of title 5” are substituted for “grade 18 of the General Schedule of the Classification Act of 1949, as amended”.

1948 Act

Prior section 508.—Based on section 312 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees, and title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§579 and 580 (R.S. §363; May 28, 1896, ch. 252, §§8, 24, 29 Stat. 181, 186; Mar. 3, 1903, ch. 1007, §1, 32 Stat. 1141; Mar. 4, 1907, ch. 2918, §1, 34 Stat. 1360; May 27, 1908, ch. 200, §1, 35 Stat. 375; July 19, 1919, ch. 24, §1, 41 Stat. 209; June 1, 1922, ch. 204, title II (part), 42 Stat. 616; Jan. 3, 1923, ch. 21, title II, 42 Stat. 1083; Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 295, 42 Stat. 1560; May 28, 1924, ch. 204, title II (part), 43 Stat. 220).

Section consolidates part of section 312 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and part of section 579 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with section 580 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

Sections 579 and 580 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., fixed specific salaries for the United States attorneys and assistants, while section 312 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., provided for a contractual arrangement for compensation of special attorneys.

According to a Department of Justice interpretation, provisions for specific salaries were superseded by section 678 of title 5, which provides for adjustment of compensation by heads of departments.
Hence, this section leaves the amount of compensation to the Attorney General.

Section 578b of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., providing that United States attorneys shall be paid for their services, was omitted as unnecessary.

Section 578c of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., providing that United States attorneys shall not receive fees in addition to their salaries, was omitted as obsolete, in view of this section and current practice.

Other provisions of section 312 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in sections 503 [now 543] and 507 [now 509 and 547] of this title, and other provisions of section 579 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in section 552 [see Prior Provisions note for that section] of this title.

Historical and Revision Notes
1966 Act	Derivation	U.S. Code	Revised Statutes and Statutes at Large
		28 U.S.C. 509.	[None].

The second paragraph of former section 509 is omitted as it was superseded by the Travel Expense Act of 1949, which is codified in subchapter I of chapter 57 of title 5, United States Code.

The second paragraph was based in part on former section 73 of title 5, 1940 ed., which was superseded by the Subsistence Expense Act of 1926.

Section 6 of the Travel Expense Act of 1949, which is codified in section 5706 of title 5, United States Code, substantially reenacted former section 73 of title 5, 1940 ed., which was repealed by the Act of June 25, 1948, ch. 646, by which title 28 was originally enacted.
The purpose of section 6 was to allow reimbursement for only such actual and necessary travel expenses incurred unless otherwise permitted by the Act of 1949 itself or by laws relating to the military.
Section 6 did not, however, provide for the exception of United States attorneys as did former section 73.

Sections 2 and 3 of the Act of 1949, which are codified in sections 5701 and 5702 of title 5, United States Code, defined the coverage of the Act and allowed for specific exclusions in the legislative and judicial branches but did not mention an exclusion in the executive branch for United States attorneys.

Section 7 of the 1949 Act, which is codified in section 5707 of title 5, United States Code, expressly vested in the Director of the Bureau of the Budget the authority to prescribe regulations covering travel allowances and the reimbursement of travel expenses.

Section 8 of the 1949 Act, which is codified in section 5708(1), (2) of title 5, United States Code, made specific exclusions from the coverage of the Act, and United States attorneys were not so excluded.

Section 9 of the 1949 Act, which is codified in section 5708(3), (4) of title 5, United States Code, modified acts inconsistent with the 1949 Act, and specifically mentioned acts which authorize reimbursement of “actual and necessary” expenses.

1948 Act

Prior section 509.—Based on sections 73 and 318 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees, and title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§586, 587 and 592 (R.S. §§368, 833, 834; Mar. 3, 1875, ch. 133, §1, 18 Stat. 452; May 28, 1896, ch. 252, §§13, 14, 24, 29 Stat. 183, 186; Mar. 4, 1907, ch. 2918, §1, 34 Stat. 1360; May 27, 1908, ch. 200, §1, 35 Stat. 375; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §291, 36 Stat. 1167; July 1, 1918, ch. 113, §1, 40 Stat. 683; July 19, 1919, ch. 24, §1, 41 Stat. 209; Dec. 24, 1942, ch. 825, §3, 56 Stat. 1089).

Section consolidates parts of sections 73 and 318 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and of sections 586, 587, and 592 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

First paragraph of this section is from section 587 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which did not apply to Alaska because of the restriction in section 591 of said title 28. However, the latter section has been superseded, in that respect, by subsequent appropriation acts, the latest being act July 5, 1946, ch. 541, title II, 60 Stat. 460, which specifically allows office expenses for United States attorneys in Alaska.
This section applies to all United States attorneys.

Section 73 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., allowed only actual traveling expenses to Government employees, except “district attorneys,” marshals and clerks of courts and their deputies.
It has been superseded by the Subsistence Expense Act of 1926. See sections 821 et seq. of said title 5.

References in section 592 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., to absence “from their respective official residences” and to going to and returning from attendance before courts, etc., were omitted as surplusage and covered by the phrase “on official business.” Language relating to Standardized Government Travel Regulations was also omitted as the reference in this section is to the provision in the Subsistence Expense Act, supra, authorizing those regulations.
Verification under oath provision was omitted as covered by section 553 [see Prior Provisions note for that section] of this title which simplifies procedure by requiring payment upon certification by the payee.
The penal provisions of title 18 are ample protection against fraud and an oath alone is no deterrent.

The requirement in section 592 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the marshals should include such payments in their accounts for auditing and allowance, was omitted as unnecessary.
See section 541 et seq. [now section 561 et seq.] of this title and section 71 et seq. of title 31, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

Section 318 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., required the Attorney General to supervise the accounts of “district” attorneys, marshals, clerks, and other court officers.
The language of this section covers that requirement.
The provision as to marshals is incorporated in section 547 [see Prior Provisions note under that section] of this title.

Quarterly expense accounts were required of United States attorneys and marshals by section 586 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
Such provision is omitted as unnecessary in view of this section and section 547 [see Prior Provisions note under that section] of this title.
Further provisions of said section 586 that office expenses of United States attorneys, assistants, and marshals should be allowed under regulations of the Attorney General and verified under oath, are simplified by this section and section 550 [see Prior Provisions note under that section] of this title.
Another provision that accounts therefor should be submitted to, examined by the district court and, when approved by the court then audited and allowed by law, was omitted.
The power of the Attorney General is sufficient.
The reference to audit and allowance was unnecessary as covered by section 71 et seq. of title 31, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Money and Finance.
Said section 586 applied also to marshals and deputies and those provisions are incorporated in section 550 [see Prior Provisions note under that section] of this title.

The exception in sections 586 and 591 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the former should not apply in Alaska was omitted as unnecessary.
Section 114 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions, requires travel expense accounts to be rendered and paid as in other districts.

Changes were made in phraseology.

Prior Provisions

A prior section 549, act June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 912, related to the marshal's power as a sheriff, prior to repeal by Pub. L. 89–554, §8(a), and reenactment in section 570 of this title by section 4(c) of Pub. L. 89–554.

The words “and at salaries fixed by” are omitted as superseded by the Classification Act of 1949, as amended, which is codified in chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5, United States Code.

1948 Act

Prior section 510.—Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§484, 593 (May 28, 1896, ch. 252, §15, 29 Stat. 183; June 30, 1906, ch. 3914, §1, 34 Stat. 753; July 19, 1919, ch. 24, §1, 41 Stat. 209).

Section consolidates and simplifies sections 484 and 593 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
For provisions with respect to classified civil service, see sections 631–684 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees.

Section 593 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., related to clerks and messengers in the office of United States attorney, southern district of New York.
Section 484 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., related to clerical assistants for all United States attorneys.
It was not affected by section 678 of title 5 U.S.C. 1940 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees, according to a Department of Justice interpretation.

Provision of said section 593 for office expenses of United States attorneys is covered by section 509 [now 549] of this title.

Said section 593 also required that payment of salaries of such clerks and messengers be made by the disbursing clerk of the Department of Justice.
Under section 550 [see Prior Provisions note below] of this title the marshals will make such payments including the office expenses of United States attorneys.

The restriction that section 484 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., did not apply to Alaska is omitted as unnecessary since section 109 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions, authorizes employment of clerical assistants to United States attorneys in Alaska by the Attorney General.

The provision in such section 484 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the need for clerical assistants be certified by the district judge, was omitted as unnecessary.
The need may be determined by the Attorney General.

1948 Act

Prior section 551.—Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§577, 578a (R.S. §846; May 28, 1896, ch. 252, §§6, 13, 24, 29 Stat. 179, 183, 186; May 27, 1908, ch. 200, §1, 35 Stat. 375; June 6, 1930, ch. 409, 46 Stat. 522; Oct. 13, 1941, ch. 431, §1, 55 Stat. 736).

Section consolidates first sentence of section 577 with section 578a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with changes of phraseology necessary to effect consolidation.
Other provisions of said section 577 are incorporated in section 1929 of this title.

The qualification that payments of witness fees or costs be made upon “order of court,” contained in said section 577 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., was omitted as obsolete and suitable reference was made to sections 1825 and 1871 of this title under which payments are now made on certificates of attendance.

Section 578a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., is rewritten in simplified terms without change of substance.
The proviso of such section 578a, prohibiting the collection of fees from the United States, was omitted as covered by section 2412 of this title, providing that the United States should be liable only for fees when such liability is expressly provided by Congress.

The provision of section 578a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., requiring that fees and emoluments collected by the marshal shall be deposited by him in accordance with the provisions of section 495 of title 31, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Money and Finance, was omitted as said section 495 governs such deposits without implementation in this section.

1948 Act

Prior section 556.—Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§395 and 396 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§273, 274, 36 Stat. 1164).

Section consolidates parts of sections 395 and 396 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
Similar provisions in said sections, relating to clerks, are incorporated in section 955 of this title.

The revised section substitutes, as simpler and more appropriate, the prohibition against practice of law “in any court of the United States” for the more involved language of section 395 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which provided that no clerks or marshals, deputies, or assistants within the district for which appointed “shall act as solicitor, proctor, attorney or counsel, in any cause depending in any of said courts, or in any district for which he is acting as such officer.”

Provisions of section 396 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for striking the name of an offender from the roll of attorneys and for recommendation of dismissal, were omitted as unnecessary and as covered by section 541 of this title.

Changes were made in phraseology.

Such individual shall be so reemployed within thirty days after making such application or after being removed from office, whichever is later.
An individual denied reemployment under this section in a position because the individual is not qualified for that position may appeal that denial to the Merit Systems Protection Board under section 7701 of title 5.

(b) Any United States marshal serving on the effective date of this section shall continue to serve for the remainder of the term for which such marshal was appointed, unless sooner removed by the President.

For purposes of uniformity, all provisions of law governing the regulation and allowance of office, travel, and subsistence expenses of all officers and employees of the courts, except those provisions relating to Supreme Court officers and employees, are incorporated in subsection (a)(6)(7) of this section.
Likewise the provisions respecting the compensation of court officers and employees, except those of the Supreme Court, are incorporated in subsection (a)(5). In each instance the power to fix and determine such salaries and expenses is transferred to the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.
This change is in conformity with the Administrative Office Act 1939 included in this chapter.

Compensation of bailiffs however is provided by sections 713 and 755 of this title and that of court reporters by section 753 of this title.

Salaries and travel expenses of Court of Claims Commissioners are covered by section 792 of this title.

The language “and the lawful fees of United States Commissioners” in subsection (a)(6) and “the offices of the United States Commissioners” in subsection (a)(9) is new.
It conforms with sections 633, 636 and 639 of this title.

Subsection (a)(5)(7) covers the provisions of section 726–1 and 726a of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which provided that probation officers’ salaries should not be less than $1,800 nor more than $3,600 per annum and their traveling expenses should not exceed more than 4 cents per mile.

Words “and officers and employees of the Administrative Office” were added in subsection (a)(7) to expressly authorize travel and subsistence expenses of such officers and employees.

The power to fix such pay and allowances is transferred to the Director as above indicated, and conforms with the Administrative Office Act of 1939. For further explanation of the general supervision of probation officers, see reviser's note under section 3654, H. Rept. to accompany H.R. 3190 for revision of title 18, U.S.C.

Subsection (a)(8) covers the provisions of section 1131 of title 26, U.S.C. 1940 ed.
Such section 1131 authorized the Tax Court, successor to the Board of Tax Appeals, to make expenditures for personal services, rent, law books, reference books, periodicals, and provided that all expenditures should be paid out of appropriations for the Tax Court, on itemized vouchers approved by the court.

Two references to “officials and employees covered by this chapter” were changed to “clerical and administrative personnel,” following the language of paragraph (a)(1), conferring general power to supervise such personnel as respects administrative matters.

Similar language was used in paragraph (b) instead of “The clerks of the district courts, their deputies and assistants, and all other employees of said courts.”

The provisions of section 374b of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., based on successive acts relating to classification and compensation of secretaries and law clerks were omitted as temporary and unnecessary in revision, in view of subsection (a)(5) of this section under which the salaries of all personnel are necessarily limited by current appropriation acts.

For increases in basic rates of compensation for other judicial officers and employees see, also, section 521 of Act June 30, 1945, ch. 212.

The designation “senior circuit judges” was changed to “chief judges of the circuits” in conformity with section 45 of this title.

Provisions of section 11–204 of District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., relating to appointment of clerk of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and deputy clerk, crier, and messenger thereof, and the provisions relating to accounting for fees, are incorporated in sections 711 and 713 of this title.
Provisions of said section, requiring the clerk of such court to give bond, were omitted as covered by section 952 of this title.
Provisions of said section, relating to regulation of clerk's fees by such court were omitted so as to render uniform the method of such regulation as prescribed by section 1913 of this title, and the provisions of said section, placing a maximum of five hundred dollars per year on the office expenditures of the clerk of such court, were omitted as inconsistent with this consolidated section.

For distribution of other provisions of sections on which this section is based, see Distribution Table.

Changes were made in phraseology and arrangement.

A Director who elects coverage under this section shall be deemed an “employee” for purposes of chapter 84 of title 5, subchapter III, regardless of whether he has waived the coverage of chapter 83, subchapter III, or chapter 84. Waiver of coverage under chapter 83, subchapter III, and election of this section shall not operate to foreclose to the Director, upon separation from service other than by retirement, such opportunity as the law may provide to secure retirement credit under chapter 83 for service as Director by depositing with interest the amount required by section 8334 of title 5. A Director who waives coverage under chapter 84 and elects this section may secure retirement credit under chapter 84 for service as Director by depositing with interest 1.3 percent of basic pay for service from January 1, 1984, through December 31, 1986, and the amount referred to in section 8422(a) of title 5, for service after December 31, 1986.

(b) Upon the retirement of a Director who has elected coverage under this section and who has served at least fifteen years and attained the age of sixty-five years the Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall pay him an annuity for life equal to 80 per centum of the salary of the office at the time of his retirement.

Upon the retirement of a Director who has elected coverage under this section and who has served at least ten years, but who is not eligible to receive an annuity under the first paragraph of this subsection, the Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall pay him an annuity for life equal to that proportion of 80 per centum of the salary of the office at the time of his retirement that the number of years of his service bears to fifteen, reduced by one-quarter of 1 per centum for each full month, if any, he is under the age of sixty-five at the time of separation from service.

(c) A Director who has elected coverage under this section and who becomes permanently disabled to perform the duties of his office shall be retired and shall receive an annuity for life equal to 80 per centum of the salary of the office at the time of his retirement if he has served at least fifteen years, or equal to that proportion of 80 percentum of such salary that the aggregate number of years of his service bears to fifteen if he has served less than fifteen years, but in no event less than 50 per centum of such salary.

(d) For the purpose of this section, “service” means service, whether or not continuous, as Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, and any service, not to exceed five years, as a judge of the United States, a Senator or Representative in Congress, or a civilian official appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.

(e) Each annuity payable under this section shall be increased by the same percentage amount and effective on the same date as annuities payable under chapter 83 of title 5, are increased as provided by section 8340 of title 5.

§631. Appointment and tenure

(a) The judges of each United States district court and the district court of the Virgin Islands shall appoint United States magistrates in such numbers and to serve at such locations within the judicial district as the conference may determine under this chapter.
In the case of a magistrate appointed by the district court of the Virgin Islands, this chapter shall apply as though the court appointing such magistrate were a United States district court.
Where there is more than one judge of a district court, the appointment, whether an original appointment or a reappointment, shall be by the concurrence of a majority of all the judges of such district court, and when there is no such concurrence, then by the chief judge.
Where the conference deems it desirable, a magistrate may be designated to serve in one or more districts adjoining the district for which he is appointed.
Such a designation shall be made by the concurrence of a majority of the judges of each of the district courts involved and shall specify the duties to be performed by the magistrate in the adjoining district or districts.

(b) No individual may be appointed or reappointed to serve as a magistrate under this chapter unless:

(1) He has been for at least five years a member in good standing of the bar of the highest court of a State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or the Virgin Islands of the United States, except that an individual who does not meet the bar membership requirements of this paragraph may be appointed and serve as a part-time magistrate if the appointing court or courts and the conference find that no qualified individual who is a member of the bar is available to serve at a specific location;

(2) He is determined by the appointing district court or courts to be competent to perform the duties of the office;

(3) In the case of an individual appointed to serve in a national park, he resides within the exterior boundaries of that park, or at some place reasonably adjacent thereto;

(4) He is not related by blood or marriage to a judge of the appointing court or courts at the time of his initial appointment; and

(5) He is selected pursuant to standards and procedures promulgated by the Judicial Conference of the United States.
Such standards and procedures shall contain provision for public notice of all vacancies in magistrate positions and for the establishment by the district courts of merit selection panels, composed of residents of the individual judicial districts, to assist the courts in identifying and recommending persons who are best qualified to fill such positions.

(c) A magistrate may hold no other civil or military office or employment under the United States: Provided, however, That, with the approval of the conference, a part-time referee in bankruptcy or a clerk or deputy clerk of a court of the United States may be appointed and serve as a part-time United States magistrate, but the conference shall fix the aggregate amount of compensation to be received for performing the duties of part-time magistrate and part-time referee in bankruptcy, clerk or deputy clerk: And provided further, That retired officers and retired enlisted personnel of the Regular and Reserve components of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, members of the Reserve components of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, and members of the Army National Guard of the United States, the Air National Guard of the United States, and the Naval Militia and of the National Guard of a State, territory, or the District of Columbia, except the National Guard disbursing officers who are on a full-time salary basis, may be appointed and serve as United States magistrates.

(d) Except as otherwise provided in sections 375 and 636(h) of this title, no individual may serve under this chapter after having attained the age of seventy years: Provided, however, That upon a majority vote of all the judges of the appointing court or courts, which is taken upon the magistrate's attaining age seventy and upon each subsequent anniversary thereof, a magistrate who has attained the age of seventy years may continue to serve and may be reappointed under this chapter.

(e) The appointment of any individual as a full-time magistrate shall be for a term of eight years, and the appointment of any individuals as a part-time magistrate shall be for a term of four years, except that the term of a full-time or part-time magistrate appointed under subsection (k) 1 shall expire upon—

(1) the expiration of the absent magistrate's term,

(2) the reinstatement of the absent magistrate in regular service in office as a magistrate,

(3) the failure of the absent magistrate to make timely application under subsection (j) 1 of this section for reinstatement in regular service in office as a magistrate after discharge or release from military service,

(4) the death or resignation of the absent magistrate, or

(5) the removal from office of the absent magistrate pursuant to subsection (i) of this section,

whichever may first occur.

(f) Upon the expiration of his term, a magistrate may, by a majority vote of the judges of the appointing district court or courts and with the approval of the judicial council of the circuit, continue to perform the duties of his office until his successor is appointed, or for 180 days after the date of the expiration of the magistrate's term, whichever is earlier.

(g) Each individual appointed as a magistrate under this section shall take the oath or affirmation prescribed by section 453 of this title before performing the duties of his office.

(h) Each appointment made by a judge or judges of a district court shall be entered of record in such court, and notice of such appointment shall be given at once by the clerk of that court to the Director.

(i) Removal of a magistrate during the term for which he is appointed shall be only for incompetency, misconduct, neglect of duty, or physical or mental disability, but a magistrate's office shall be terminated if the conference determines that the services performed by his office are no longer needed.
Removal shall be by the judges of the district court for the judicial district in which the magistrate serves; where there is more than one judge of a district court, removal shall not occur unless a majority of all the judges of such court concur in the order of removal; and when there is a tie vote of the judges of the district court on the question of the removal or retention in office of a magistrate, then removal shall be only by a concurrence of a majority of all the judges of the council.
In the case of a magistrate appointed under the third sentence of subsection (a) of this section, removal shall not occur unless a majority of all the judges of the appointing district courts concur in the order of removal; and where there is a tie vote on the question of the removal or retention in office of a magistrate, then removal shall be only by a concurrence of a majority of all the judges of the council or councils.
Before any order or removal shall be entered, a full specification of the charges shall be furnished to the magistrate, and he shall be accorded by the judge or judges of the removing court, courts, council, or councils an opportunity to be heard on the charges.

(j) Upon the grant by the appropriate district court or courts of a leave of absence to a magistrate entitled to such relief under chapter 43 of title 38, such court or courts may proceed to appoint, in the manner specified in subsection (a) of this section, another magistrate, qualified for appointment and service under subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, who shall serve for the period specified in subsection (e) of this section.

(k) A United States magistrate appointed under this chapter shall be exempt from the provisions of subchapter I of chapter 63 of title 5.

Historical and Revision Notes

1948 Act

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§526 and 527, sections 27, 66, 80e, 100, 117e, 129, 172, 198e, 204e, 256d, 395e, 403c–5, 403h–5, 404c–5, and 408m of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Conservation, and section 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions (May 27, 1894, ch. 72, §5, 28 Stat. 74; May 28, 1896, ch. 252, §§19, 20, 29 Stat. 184; Apr. 12, 1900, ch. 191, §34, 31 Stat. 84; Mar. 2, 1901, ch. 814, 31 Stat. 956; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §291, 36 Stat. 1167; Jan. 7, 1913, ch. 6, 37 Stat. 648; Aug. 22, 1914, ch. 264, §6, 38 Stat. 700; June 30, 1916, ch. 197, §6, 39 Stat. 245; Aug. 21, 1916, ch. 368, §6, 39 Stat. 523; Mar. 2, 1917, ch. 145, §41, 39 Stat. 965; June 2, 1920, ch. 218, §§7, 8, 41 Stat. 733; Mar. 4, 1921, ch. 161, §1, 41 Stat. 1412; Dec. 13, 1926, ch. 6, §1, 44 Stat. 919; Apr. 25, 1928, ch. 434, §6, 45 Stat. 460; Apr. 26, 1928, ch. 438, §6, 45 Stat. 464; Mar. 2, 1929, ch. 583, §6, 45 Stat. 1538; Apr. 19, 1930, ch. 200, §6, 46 Stat. 228; June 25, 1935, ch. 309, §1, 49 Stat. 422; Aug. 19, 1937, ch. 703, §5, 50 Stat. 702; Mar. 26, 1938, ch. 51, §2, 52 Stat. 118; June 25, 1938, ch. 684, §1, 52 Stat. 1164; June 28, 1938, ch. 778, §1, 52 Stat. 1213; Mar. 4, 1940, ch. 40, §2, 54 Stat. 43; Mar. 6, 1942, ch. 150, §5, 56 Stat. 134; Mar. 6, 1942, ch. 151, §5, 56 Stat. 137; Apr. 29, 1942, ch. 264, §5, 56 Stat. 260; June 5, 1942, ch. 341, §5, 56 Stat. 318; Dec. 28, 1945, ch. 592, 59 Stat. 659, 660; Apr. 23, 1946, ch. 202, §1, 60 Stat. 119, 120).

Section consolidates section 526 and a portion of 527, both of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with provisions of sections 27, 66, 80e, 100, 117e, 129, 172, 198e, 204e, 256d, 395e, 403c–5, 403h–5, 404c–5 and 408m of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and provisions of section 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions, relating to appointment of United States commissioners.
For other provisions of said sections see Distribution Table.

Some of the provisions of section 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions were retained in that title.

The provision of sections 395e, 403c–5, 404c–5, and 408m of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for appointment of the Park Commissioner in the Hawaii National Park, Shenandoah National Park, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Mammoth Cave National Park and Isle Royale National Park upon “the recommendation of the Secretary of the Interior” was omitted as inconsistent not only with other provisions of this title but with other statutes applicable to other national parks.

All such park commissioners are United States commissioners and the revision of these sections makes possible uniformity and consistency in administrative matters concerning such commissioners. (See, also, sections 604 and 634 of this title.)

Words “the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts” were substituted for “Attorney General” in section 526 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., in view of the general supervision by the Director over clerks and commissioners under section 601 et seq. of this title.

See, also, section 751 of this title prohibiting clerks from receiving compensation in another capacity.

First sentence of subsection (b) was substituted for the provision in section 527 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., prohibiting specified persons from acting as commissioners.

Words “at such places in the district as may be designated by the district court,” in section 526 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as unnecessary.

A provision in section 526 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that commissioners should have the same powers and duties as are conferred and imposed by law, was omitted as superfluous.

The phrase in sections 526 and 527 of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., “except as provided in section 591” and section 591, the effect of which was to except Alaska from this section, were omitted as unnecessary.
This revised section by its terms limits the section and chapter 43 of this title to commissioners appointed by a “district court,” which includes the courts enumerated in chapter 5 of this title but not those of Alaska, Canal Zone, or Virgin Islands.

Sections from title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., contained no tenure provisions.

Changes in phraseology were made.

Prior residence requirement for national park commissioners in section 635.—Based on sections 1a and 403c–9 of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Conservation (Aug. 19, 1937, ch. 703, §8, 50 Stat. 702; June 28, 1938, ch. 778, §1, 52 Stat. 1213).

Section consolidates section 1a with part of section 403c–9 of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to residence of a national park commissioner.

The provisions of sections 1a and 403c–9 of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to designation by the Secretary of the Interior of some place of residence reasonably adjacent to the park was modified by making such designation subject to the approval of the appointing court.

1949 Act

This amendment conforms the language of section 631(b) to the provisions of section 35 of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended by the act of June 28, 1946 (§3, 60 Stat. 324), that full-time referees in bankruptcy may not be appointed United States Commissioners.

This amendment also removes an ambiguity from section 631(b) by making it clear that the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts has power to establish maximum limits of compensation to be received for performing the combined offices of commissioner and clerk or deputy clerk.
This was the intent of sections 631 and 751 of title 28. (See the fifteenth paragraph of the reviser's note to the latter section, H. Rept.
No. 308, April 25, 1947, p. A90, to accompany H.R. 3214, 80th Cong.)

§633. Determination of number, locations, and salaries of magistrates

(a) Surveys by the Director.—

(1) The Director shall, within one year immediately following the date of the enactment of the Federal Magistrates Act, make a careful survey of conditions in judicial districts to determine (A) the number of appointments of full-time magistrates and part-time magistrates required to be made under this chapter to provide for the expeditious and effective administration of justice, (B) the locations at which such officers shall serve, and (C) their respective salaries under section 634 of this title.
Thereafter, the Director shall, from time to time, make such surveys, general or local, as the conference shall deem expedient.

(2) In the course of any survey, the Director shall take into account local conditions in each judicial district, including the areas and the populations to be served, the transportation and communications facilities available, the amount and distribution of business of the type expected to arise before officers appointed under this chapter (including such matters as may be assigned under section 636(b) of this chapter), and any other material factors.
The Director shall give consideration to suggestions from any interested parties, including district judges, United States commissioners or officers appointed under this chapter, United States attorneys, bar associations, and other parties having relevant experience or information.

(3) The surveys shall be made with a view toward creating and maintaining a system of full-time United States magistrates.
However, should the Director find, as a result of any such surveys, areas in which the employment of a full-time magistrate would not be feasible or desirable, he shall recommend the appointment of part-time United States magistrates in such numbers and at such locations as may be required to permit prompt and efficient issuance of process and to permit individuals charged with criminal offenses against the United States to be brought before a judicial officer of the United States promptly after arrest.

(b) Determination by the Conference.—Upon the completion of the initial surveys required by subsection (a) of this section, the Director shall report to the district courts, the councils, and the conference his recommendations concerning the number of full-time magistrates and part-time magistrates, their respective locations, and the amount of their respective salaries under section 634 of this title.
The district courts shall advise their respective councils, stating their recommendations and the reasons therefor; the councils shall advise the conference, stating their recommendations and the reasons therefor, and shall also report to the conference the recommendations of the district courts.
The conference shall determine, in the light of the recommendations of the Director, the district courts, and the councils, the number of full-time United States magistrates and part-time United States magistrates, the locations at which they shall serve, and their respective salaries.
Such determinations shall take effect in each judicial district at such time as the district court for such judicial district shall determine, but in no event later than one year after they are promulgated.

The provisions of some of these sections that the park commissioner should be “paid an annual salary, as appropriated for by Congress, payable quarterly” were rewritten upon advice of the Judicial Conference Committee on the Revision of the Judicial Code appointed by the Chief Justice of the United States, in order to place administration supervision of commissioners upon the district court and the Judicial Conference of the United States.

The provisions of some of these sections for deposit of fees, costs, expenses, fines, and penalties with the clerk of district court were rewritten to provide merely that he shall account for the same as public moneys.

The provisions of some of these sections with reference to salaries of the United States attorney and his assistants and the United States marshal and his deputies were omitted as covered by sections 508 [now 548] and 552 [see Prior Provisions note for that section] of this title.

Such expenses and compensation shall be determined and paid by the Director under such regulations as the Director shall prescribe with the approval of the conference.
The Administrator of General Services shall provide such magistrates with necessary courtrooms, office space, furniture and facilities within United States courthouses or office buildings owned or occupied by departments or agencies of the United States, or should suitable courtroom and office space not be available within any such courthouse or office building, the Administrator of General Services, at the request of the Director, shall procure and pay for suitable courtroom and office space, furniture and facilities for such magistrate in another building, but only if such request has been approved as necessary by the judicial council of the appropriate circuit.

Historical and Revision Notes

Prior section 663.—Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§597, 597a, 597b, 597c (May 28, 1896, ch. 252, §§21, 24, 29 Stat. 184, 186; Aug. 1, 1946, ch. 721, §§1–4, 60 Stat. 752, 753).

The provision of section 597c of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., excepting commissioners in the Territory of Alaska was omitted as unnecessary since this exception is implicit in the revised section.
The words “in each judicial district” limit the section to the commissioners in the districts enumerated in chapter 5 which includes Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and District of Columbia but omits Alaska, Canal Zone, [Guam] and Virgin Islands.

Salaries of park commissioners are provided by section 634 of this title.

Changes were made in phraseology.

(A) a judge may designate a magistrate to hear and determine any pretrial matter pending before the court, except a motion for injunctive relief, for judgment on the pleadings, for summary judgment, to dismiss or quash an indictment or information made by the defendant, to suppress evidence in a criminal case, to dismiss or to permit maintenance of a class action, to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and to involuntarily dismiss an action.
A judge of the court may reconsider any pretrial matter under this subparagraph (A) where it has been shown that the magistrate's order is clearly erroneous or contrary to law.

(B) a judge may also designate a magistrate to conduct hearings, including evidentiary hearings, and to submit to a judge of the court proposed findings of fact and recommendations for the disposition, by a judge of the court, of any motion excepted in subparagraph (A), of applications for posttrial 2 relief made by individuals convicted of criminal offenses and of prisoner petitions challenging conditions of confinement.

(C) the magistrate shall file his proposed findings and recommendations under subparagraph (B) with the court and a copy shall forthwith be mailed to all parties.

Upon the consent of the parties, pursuant to their specific written request, any other part-time magistrate may exercise such jurisdiction, if such magistrate meets the bar membership requirements set forth in section 631(b)(1) and the chief judge of the district court certifies that a full-time magistrate is not reasonably available in accordance with guidelines established by the judicial council of the circuit.
When there is more than one judge of a district court, designation under this paragraph shall be by the concurrence of a majority of all the judges of such district court, and when there is no such concurrence, then by the chief judge.

(2) If a magistrate is designated to exercise civil jurisdiction under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the clerk of court shall, at the time the action is filed, notify the parties of the availability of a magistrate to exercise such jurisdiction.
The decision of the parties shall be communicated to the clerk of court.
Thereafter, either the district court judge or the magistrate may again advise the parties of the availability of the magistrate, but in so doing, shall also advise the parties that they are free to withhold consent without adverse substantive consequences.
Rules of court for the reference of civil matters to magistrates shall include procedures to protect the voluntariness of the parties’ consent.

(3) Upon entry of judgment in any case referred under paragraph (1) of this subsection, an aggrieved party may appeal directly to the appropriate United States court of appeals from the judgment of the magistrate in the same manner as an appeal from any other judgment of a district court.
In this circumstance, the consent of the parties allows a magistrate designated to exercise civil jurisdiction under paragraph (1) of this subsection to direct the entry of a judgment of the district court in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as a limitation of any party's right to seek review by the Supreme Court of the United States.

(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (3) of this subsection, at the time of reference to a magistrate, the parties may further consent to appeal on the record to a judge of the district court in the same manner as on an appeal from a judgment of the district court to a court of appeals.
Wherever possible the local rules of the district court and the rules promulgated by the conference shall endeavor to make such appeal inexpensive.
The district court may affirm, reverse, modify, or remand the magistrate's judgment.

(5) Cases in the district courts under paragraph (4) of this subsection may be reviewed by the appropriate United States court of appeals upon petition for leave to appeal by a party stating specific objections to the judgment.
Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to be a limitation on any party's right to seek review by the Supreme Court of the United States.

(6) The court may, for good cause shown on its own motion, or under extraordinary circumstances shown by any party, vacate a reference of a civil matter to a magistrate under this subsection.

(7) The magistrate shall, subject to guidelines of the Judicial Conference, determine whether the record taken pursuant to this section shall be taken by electronic sound recording, by a court reporter, or by other means.

Upon the commission of any such act or conduct, the magistrate shall forthwith certify the facts to a judge of the district court and may serve or cause to be served upon any person whose behavior is brought into question under this section an order requiring such person to appear before a judge of that court upon a day certain to show cause why he should not be adjudged in contempt by reason of the facts so certified.
A judge of the district court shall thereupon, in a summary manner, hear the evidence as to the act or conduct complained of and, if it is such as to warrant punishment, punish such person in the same manner and to the same extent as for a contempt committed before a judge of the court, or commit such person upon the conditions applicable in the case of defiance of the process of the district court or misconduct in the presence of a judge of that court.

(f) In an emergency and upon the concurrence of the chief judges of the districts involved, a United States magistrate may be temporarily assigned to perform any of the duties specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this section in a judicial district other than the judicial district for which he has been appointed.
No magistrate shall perform any of such duties in a district to which he has been temporarily assigned until an order has been issued by the chief judge of such district specifying (1) the emergency by reason of which he has been transferred, (2) the duration of his assignment, and (3) the duties which he is authorized to perform.
A magistrate so assigned shall not be entitled to additional compensation but shall be reimbursed for actual and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of his duties in accordance with section 635.

A magistrate may be assigned by a judge of any United States district court to perform the verification required by section 4108 and the appointment of counsel authorized by section 4109 of title 18, United States Code, and may perform such functions beyond the territorial limits of the United States.
A magistrate assigned such functions shall have no authority to perform any other function within the territory of a foreign country.

(h) A United States magistrate who has retired may, upon the consent of the chief judge of the district involved, be recalled to serve as a magistrate in any judicial district by the judicial council of the circuit within which such district is located.
Upon recall, a magistrate may receive a salary for such service in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Judicial Conference, subject to the restrictions on the payment of an annuity set forth in section 377 of this title or in subchapter III of chapter 83, and chapter 84, of title 5 which are applicable to such magistrate.
The requirements set forth in subsections (a), (b)(3), and (d) of section 631, and paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of such section to the extent such paragraph requires membership of the bar of the location in which an individual is to serve as a magistrate, shall not apply to the recall of a retired magistrate under this subsection or section 375 of this title.
Any other requirement set forth in section 631(b) shall apply to the recall of a retired magistrate under this subsection or section 375 of this title unless such retired magistrate met such requirement upon appointment or reappointment as a magistrate under section 631.

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§325, 326, 327, 541 and 542 (Feb. 22, 1875, ch. 95, §§2, 3, 18 Stat. 333; Mar. 3, 1883, ch. 143, 22 Stat. 631; Mar. 15, 1898, ch. 68, §8, 30 Stat. 317; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§219, 220, 221, 291, 36 Stat. 1152, 1153, 1167; June 10, 1921, ch. 18, §304, 42 Stat. 24).

This section consolidates sections 541 and 542 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with parts of sections 325, 326 and 327 of such title.

The provisions in said section 325 relating to appointment of a marshal and reporter are incorporated in sections 672 and 673 of this title.

The provisions in section 327 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to duties and liabilities of the clerk's deputies are incorporated in section 954 of this title.

The provision of section 326 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that a duly certified copy of the clerk's bond should be competent evidence in any court, is incorporated in section 1737 of this title.

The provision that the clerk shall be subject to removal by the Court is new.
Section 327 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., contained a similar provision as to deputies, but fixed no term of office for the clerk and made no provision for his removal.
The Supreme Court held, in 1839, that a district judge had power to remove his clerk at pleasure in absence of any law fixing the clerk's tenure.
In re Hennen, 38 U.S. 230, 13 Pet. 230, 10 L.Ed. 138. (See, also Myers v. U.S., 1926, 47 S.Ct. 21, 272 U.S. 52, 71 L.Ed. 160.)

The provision in section 326 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the clerk's bond be not less than $5,000 and not more than $20,000 was omitted.
The Supreme Court should have wide discretion in such administrative matters. (See Hearings before Appropriations Committee, House of Representatives, 78th Cong., 2d sess., on Judiciary Appropriation Bill for 1945, page 102.)

A provision of section 326 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that a renewed or augmented bond should be required upon the Attorney General's motion and after thirty days’ notice was omitted.
The manner of requiring such bond is left to the Court's discretion by the revised section.

A further provision of section 326 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the failure to furnish such renewed or augmented bond should vacate the clerk's office was omitted as unnecessary, since the clerk is removable by the Court under this section.

The references in section 541 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., to return “under oath” to be made “on the 1st day of January of each year, or thirty days thereafter” and “on a form prescribed by the Attorney General”, were omitted as fully covered by the revised language “annual returns” under “regulations prescribed by the Court”. Verification seems unnecessary especially as clerks of the courts of appeals are not required to submit similar returns under oath (see section 711 of this title). “Court” was substituted for “Attorney General”, since the latter's powers and functions in court administrative matters have been transferred to the Director of the Administration Office of the United States Courts. (See sections 604 and 607 of this title.) The Director, however, exercises no authority in Supreme Court matters.

Section 542 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., provided that the clerk “shall not retain”, out of fees received, more than $6,000 annually above clerk hire and expenses; that the surplus should be paid into the Treasury.
Such indirect and unusual provision is simplified in this section by providing that his salary shall be fixed by the Court.
Such salary limitation is omitted as inconsistent with larger salaries paid other clerks of courts.

The provisions that the Court shall fix the compensation of deputy clerks, and that the clerk shall fix the compensation of assistants and messengers with the approval of the Chief Justice, are new.
Current appropriation Acts providing that the compensation of officers and employees of the Supreme Court, other than clerk and reporter shall be fixed by the court, unnecessarily burden the court with administrative details.
Provision for allowance and approval of payments of compensation and office expenses by the clerk upon allowance and approval by the Chief Justice, instead of by the Court, was inserted with the approval of the Judicial Conference Committee on Revision of the Judicial Code as not inconsistent with section 542 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

References in sections 541 and 542 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., to certification of expenses by the justices and for audit and allowances by the General Accounting Office, were omitted as unnecessary in view of this section.

Changes were made in phraseology.

Appropriations

Section 3 of Pub. L. 88–279 provided that: “There are hereby authorized to be appropriated annually such sums as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act [amending this section and section 672 of this title].”

(8) Oversee the Supreme Court Police.

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§325, 331, and section 13d of title 40, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Public Buildings, Property and Works (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§219, 224, 36 Stat. 1152, 1153; April 11, 1928, ch. 358, 45 Stat. 424; May 7, 1934, ch. 222, §4, 48 Stat. 668).

This section consolidates part of section 325 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with section 331 of such title and section 13d of title 40, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

Provisions of section 325 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to appointment of clerk and reporter of the Supreme Court are incorporated in sections 671 and 673 of this title.

Provision of section 331 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., fixing the marshal's salary at “not to exceed $5,500 per annum” was omitted and the court given authority to fix the salary in conformity with sections 671 and 673 of this title relating to the clerk and the reporter.

Part of subsection (c)(5) is new.
It recognizes the propriety of certification by the Court Librarian of vouchers for expenditures for the library. (See reviser's note under section 674 of this title.)

The marshal's duties as superintendent of the Supreme Court building are incorporated in section 13c of title 40, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

Changes were made in phraseology.

Appropriations

§673. Reporter

(a) The Supreme Court may appoint and fix the compensation of a reporter of its decisions who shall be subject to removal by the Court.

(b) The reporter may appoint and fix the compensation of necessary professional and clerical assistants and other employees, with the approval of the Court or the Chief Justice of the United States.

(c) The reporter shall, under the direction of the Court or the Chief Justice, prepare the decisions of the Court for publication in bound volumes and advance copies in pamphlet installments.

The reporter shall determine the quality and size of the paper, type, format, proofs and binding subject to the approval of the Court or the Chief Justice.

(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 919.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§325, 332, and 333 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§219, 225, 226, 36 Stat. 1152, 1153; July 1, 1922, ch. 267, §§1, 2, 42 Stat. 816; May 29, 1926, ch. 425, §1, 44 Stat. 677).

This section consolidates sections 332 and 333 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with part of section 325 of such title.

Provisions of section 325 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to appointment of clerk and marshal of the Supreme Court are incorporated in sections 671 and 672 of this title.

The provision as to tenure is new and is added to insure consistency with other revised sections relating to tenure of court officers.

The provisions of section 333 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., fixing the reporter's salary at $8,000 per annum were omitted and the Court given authority to fix the salary in conformity with sections 671 and 672 of this title relating to the clerk and the marshal.

Provisions of section 333 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for allowance of stationery, supplies, equipment, and office rent are omitted as obsolete.
Offices are now provided in the Supreme Court building and supplies are furnished by the marshal.

The last sentence of section 333 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to the payment of the reporter's expenses from appropriation for the Supreme Court, was omitted as surplusage.

The revised section makes specific the implied power to fix the compensation of the reporter's assistants.

The provision in section 332 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., authorizing the Public Printer to do the printing referred to in such section, was omitted as unnecessary. (See section 111 of title 44, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Public Printing and Documents.)

Authority for making an appropriation to carry into effect the provisions of this section relating to compensation and allowances of the reporter, compensation of his assistants, and preparation of the decisions of the Supreme Court for publication, is contained in section 336 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. (Acts July 1, 1922, ch. 267, §5, 42 Stat. 818; May 29, 1926, ch. 425, §3, 44 Stat. 678), which is omitted, but not repealed, as unnecessary in this revision.

§674. Librarian

(a) The Supreme Court may appoint a librarian, whose salary it shall fix, and who shall be subject to removal by the Court.

(b) The librarian shall, with the approval of the Chief Justice, appoint necessary assistants and fix their compensation and make rules governing the use of the library.

(d) The librarian shall certify to the marshal for payment vouchers covering expenditures for the purchase of such books and other material, and for binding, rebinding and repairing the same.

(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 919; June 6, 1972, Pub. L. 92–310, title II, §206(d), 86 Stat. 203.)

Historical and Revision Notes

This section gives statutory recognition to the office of librarian.
For many years the Court has appointed its librarian directly through the Chief Justice, rather than through the marshal.
Other members of the library staff are appointed by the librarian, with the approval of the Chief Justice.

Under this section the marshal will not be required to certify to expenditures for some 2,000 books bought for the library each year but this will be the duty of the librarian.

§675. Law clerks and secretaries

The Chief Justice of the United States, and the associate justices of the Supreme Court may appoint law clerks and secretaries whose salaries shall be fixed by the Court.

(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 919.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1926 ed., §328 (June 1, 1922, ch. 204, title II, 42 Stat. 614; Jan. 3, 1923, ch. 21, title II, 42 Stat. 1081; May 28, 1924, ch. 204, title II, 43 Stat. 218; Feb. 27, 1925, ch. 364, title II, 43 Stat. 1028).

Section is derived from Appropriation Acts for fiscal years cited in the credits.
It was omitted from the 1934 and 1940 editions of the U.S. Code because it was considered to be probably of a temporary nature.
This section is consistent with other provisions authorizing the appointment of similar personnel for circuit and district judges.

The 1942 appropriation act (July 2, 1942, ch. 472, title IV, 56 Stat. 501) made provision for “all other officers and employees, whose compensation shall be fixed by the Court, except as otherwise provided by law and who may be assigned by the Chief Justice to any office or work of the Court.”

The salary limitation of $3,600 was omitted and the Court authorized to fix law clerks’ salaries.
Current appropriation acts provide that salaries of the Court's officers and employees, except the clerk and reporter, shall be fixed by the Court.

See section 711 et seq. and section 751 et seq., of this title, relating to appointment of law clerks and secretaries to circuit and district judges.

Changes were made in phraseology.

§676. Printing and binding

(a) The printing and binding for the Supreme Court, including the printing and binding of individual copies, advance pamphlet installments, and bound volumes, of its decisions, whether requisitioned or ordered by the Court or any of its officers or by any other office or agency, and whether paid for by, or charged to the appropriation for, the Court or any other office or agency, shall be done by the printer or printers whom the Court or the Chief Justice of the United States may select, unless it shall otherwise order.

(b) Whenever advance pamphlet installments and bound volumes of the Court's decisions are printed by a private printer, an adequate number of copies for distribution in accordance with the requirements of section 411 of this title and for sale to the public shall be provided and made available for these purposes in such manner and at such prices as may be determined from time to time by the Supreme Court or the Chief Justice of the United States, in lieu of compliance by the Public Printer and the Superintendent of Documents with the requirements of sections 411 and 412 of this title with respect to such copies.
Pending distribution or sale, such copies shall be the property of the United States and shall be held in the custody of the marshal or such other person, organization, or agency, as the Supreme Court or the Chief Justice of the United States may designate.

(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 919; May 24, 1949, ch. 139, §74, 63 Stat. 100; Oct. 31, 1951, ch. 655, §45, 65 Stat. 725.)

Historical and Revision Notes

1948 Act

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §354 (Feb. 27, 1925, ch. 364, title II, 43 Stat. 1028; Apr. 29, 1926, ch. 195, title II, 44 Stat. 344; Feb. 24, 1927, ch. 189, title II, 44 Stat. 1194; Feb. 15, 1928, ch. 57, title II, 45 Stat. 79; Jan. 25, 1929, ch. 102, title II, 45 Stat. 1109; Apr. 18, 1930, ch. 184, title II, 46 Stat. 188; Feb. 23, 1931, ch. 280, title II, 46 Stat. 1323; July 1, 1932, ch. 361, title II, 47 Stat. 490; Mar. 1, 1933, ch. 144, title II, 47 Stat. 1382; Apr. 7, 1934, ch. 104, title II, 48 Stat. 539).

The section was expanded to include the printing and binding of the official edition of the court's decisions, thus making possible an economy in the expenditure of Government funds by having the printing and binding done by the same printer.

Subsection (b) of the revised section was supplied to conform to sections 411 and 412 of this title.

1949 Act

This section corrects a grammatical error in subsection (a) of section 676 of title 28, U.S.C.

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§221 and 222, 544 and 546 and District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., §11–204 (Mar. 3, 1891, ch. 517, §2, 26 Stat. 826; Feb. 9, 1893, ch. 74, §4, 27 Stat. 435; July 30, 1894, ch. 172, §1, 28 Stat. 160; June 6, 1900, ch. 791, §1, 31 Stat. 639; Mar. 3, 1901, ch. 854, §224, 31 Stat. 1224; June 30, 1902, ch. 1329, 32 Stat. 528; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§124, 125, 36 Stat. 1132; Aug. 23, 1912, ch. 350, 37 Stat. 412; Feb. 22, 1921, ch. 70, §7, 41 Stat. 1144; June 1, 1922, ch. 204, title II, 42 Stat. 616; Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 265, 42 Stat. 1488; May 21, 1928, ch. 659, 45 Stat. 645).

This section consolidates section 546 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with parts of sections 221, 222, and 544 of such title and a part of section 11–204 of the District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed.
Other provisions of such sections are incorporated in sections 604, 713, 954, 956, 961, and 962 of this title.
Some provisions of section 11–204 of the District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., were retained in that code. (See reviser's note under section 604 of this title.)

Discrepancies between such section 11–204 of District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., and the more general provisions of title 28 were eliminated by adopting the more general provisions.

Words “Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts” were substituted for “Attorney General,” in view of the act of Aug. 7, 1939, ch. 501, §6, 53 Stat. 1226, 28 U.S.C., 1940 ed., following §446.

A provision that the returns should be filed annually was changed to place the times of accounting within the discretion of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, who has supervision over such accounts. (See section 604 of this title.)

This section is in harmony with section 671 of this title as to accounting similarly by the Clerk of the Supreme Court.

“Court of appeals” was substituted for “circuit court of appeals” to conform to section 43 of this title.

The provision that each clerk shall be removable by the court is new.
Section 222 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., provided that deputies might be removed at the pleasure of the clerk, subject to the court's approval, and there was no term of office specified for the clerk and no provision for his removal.

The words “and other necessary employees” were added in subsection (b) to supply an omission of existing law and to give statutory authority for the appointment of necessary employees for which compensation is annually appropriated.

Changes were made in phraseology.

Historical and Revision Notes

1948 Act

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §547, and section 11–204 of District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., (Mar. 3, 1891, ch. 517, §9, 26 Stat. 829; Feb. 9, 1893, ch. 74, §4, 27 Stat. 435; July 30, 1894, ch. 172, §1, 28 Stat. 160; Mar. 3, 1901, ch. 854, §224, 31 Stat. 1224; June 30, 1902, ch. 1329, 32 Stat. 528; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §291, 36 Stat. 1167; Aug. 23, 1912, ch. 350, 37 Stat. 412; Feb. 22, 1921, ch. 70, §7, 41 Stat. 1144; Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 265, 42 Stat. 1488; May 21, 1928, ch. 659, 45 Stat. 645).

Section consolidates parts of section 11–204 of the District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., and section 547 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

The Judicial Code provided for the appointment of assistants and messengers in the Supreme Court, criers and “persons to wait upon juries” in the district courts, a messenger in the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, and a bailiff and a chief messenger in the Court of Claims (see title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§9, 244, 305, 331) and also provided (see same title, §547) that criers, bailiffs and messengers of the courts of appeals should be allowed the same compensation as allowed for similar services in the district courts, but did not provide for the appointment of said criers, bailiffs and messengers.
This section authorizes such appointments.

The provisions of section 224 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the United States marshal shall provide for the expenses of criers, bailiffs and messengers for the circuit courts of appeals are superseded by sections 601–610 of this title vesting such functions in the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.

Provisions of section 11–204 of District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., relating to appointment and compensation of clerk of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia are incorporated in sections 711 and 604 of this title, respectively.
Other provisions of such section were retained in the District of Columbia Code. (See reviser's note under section 604 of this title.)

Compensation of bailiffs is provided by section 755 of this title.
Other provisions of section 547 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to compensation of criers, clerks, and messengers are incorporated in section 604 of this title.

Marshal for the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia was authorized by the District of Columbia Appropriation Act of June 29, 1937, 50 Stat. 378.

The duties of criers and bailiffs are made specific consistently with section 755 of this title, and existing administrative practice.

The removal provisions are added to make this section consistent with the same provisions in other sections relating to tenure of court officers.

Changes in phraseology and arrangement were made.

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§6, 7, 8, 524, 557, 567, 568, and 569, sections 644 and 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions, and section 11–401 of the District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed.

This section consolidates provisions of section 11–401 of the District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., sections 644 and 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions, and title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., sections 6, 7, 8, 524, 557, 567, 568, and 569 relating to district court clerks.
Other provisions of such sections 8 and 524 are incorporated in sections 505 [now 545], 541 [see 561], and 954 of this title and other provisions of such section 11–401 of the District of Columbia Code have been retained in such Code.

Words “with the approval of the court” were substituted for “Attorney General.” The power to approve appointment of court officers is more properly a judicial one. (See section 711 of this title.)

The provision in section 6 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the clerk be appointed by the district judge or senior judge where there was more than one member of the court was changed and the power vested in the court.

The provisions of section 644 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions, relating to compensation of clerks and deputy clerks were omitted as covered by section 604 of this title.
Other provisions of said section 644 are incorporated in section 753 of this title.

Provision for similar officers in Alaska, Canal Zone, and the Virgin Islands is made by sections 106, 1349, and 1405y, respectively, of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
A part of section 863 of said title 48, was retained in title 48. For remainder of such section, see Distribution Table.

Words in sections 6 and 7 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., “Except as otherwise provided for by law,” were omitted as obsolete and superfluous.

References in section 7 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the clerk recommend appointment of deputies and clerical assistants were omitted as unnecessary.

The provision that each clerk shall be subject to removal by the court is new.
No tenure was provided for by title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., but said title contained provisions that other clerks should hold office during the pleasure of the courts which appointed them, and that deputies should hold office during the pleasure of the clerks.
The Supreme Court held, in 1839, that a judge of a district court could remove the clerk thereof at pleasure in absence of any law fixing the clerk's tenure.
In re Hennen, 38 U.S. 230, 13 Pet. 230, 10 L.Ed. 138. (See also, Meyers v. U.S., 47 S.Ct. 21, 272 U.S. 52, 71 L.Ed. 160.)

Words “circuit or” after “Every clerk of the” in section 524 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted because of the abolition of the circuit courts by act Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §289, 36 Stat. 1167, title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §430.

The provisions in section 524 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the clerk shall give his personal attention to his official duties, and declaring his office vacant upon removal from his district or neglect of duty, were omitted as covered by the removal provision of this section.

The provision permitting the clerk of the district court for the District of Columbia to reside within twenty miles of the District of Columbia was added because of the relatively small and congested area of the District, as a result of which few federal officers are appointed from the District or reside therein.

The provision in subsection (b) of this section authorizing judges to designate the places for maintaining offices by the clerks was added because of many special provisions, in sections 141–196 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for the maintenance of offices by the clerks of the district courts at various particular places.
These provisions have been omitted, on revision, as covered by the more general provisions of this section.
For residence requirements of United States attorneys and marshals, see sections 505 [now 545] and 541 [see 561] of this title.

A provision that a breach of section 569 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., should be deemed a vacation of the offender's appointment, was omitted as covered by the removal provision of this section.

The provision of section 569 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., limiting the compensation of a clerk who is appointed United States commissioner, to $3,000 a year for both offices was omitted as obsolete.
The proper adjustment of the compensation of such clerks is an administrative matter more appropriately regulated by the Director of the Administrative Office under the Supervision of the Judicial Conference of the United States. (See section 604 of this title.)

Reference in sections 557, 567 and 568 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., to accounting by district court clerks in Alaska, were omitted as covered by sections 106 and 107 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions, relating to duties of those clerks.

References in sections 557 and 567 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., to the clerk of the district court of the United States for the District of Columbia, were omitted as covered by words “The clerk of each district court of the United States.”

As revised, this section is in harmony with the provisions in chapters 45 and 47 of this title relating to accounting by the clerk of the Supreme Court and clerks of the courts of appeals.

Provisions as to time and method of accounting and settlement of accounts were omitted as covered by chapter 41 of this title giving the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts supervision over such accounts, and of chapter 2, Audit and Settlement of Accounts, of title 31, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Money and Finance.

Provisions as to particular fees and moneys to be accounted for were omitted as covered by words “all fees, costs and other moneys.” Included in such provisions was a provision as to naturalization fees, but a later act, now appearing in section 742 of title 8, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Aliens and Nationality, provided a different method of accounting and an exception expressly referring to such section was inserted in this section.

Changes were made in phraseology.

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§5b and 128 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §118b, as added Feb. 17, 1936, ch. 75, 49 Stat. 1140; May 14, 1940, ch. 189, title IV, 54 Stat. 210; June 28, 1941, ch. 258, title IV, 55 Stat. 301; July 2, 1942, ch. 472, title IV, 56 Stat. 504).

This section consolidates provisions of sections 5b and 128 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to appointment of law clerks for district judges.

Words in section 128 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., “but there shall not be appointed more than thirty-five of such law clerks during the first fiscal year of the enactment of this section” were omitted as executed and obsolete.
Words “Thereafter such number in excess of thirty-five per year shall be limited by necessity of each case as hereinabove provided” were also deleted as superseded by section 5b of said title and obsolete.
The Director of the Administrative Office has expressed such views.
Chief judge of the circuit was substituted for senior circuit judge to conform to section 44 of this title.

Provisions of section 128 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to salary, or compensation of such clerks are incorporated in section 604 of this title. (See reviser's note under that section.)

The provisions in section 5b of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that district judges shall not appoint more than three law clerks in any one circuit was not repeated in the Judiciary Appropriation Acts, 1944, 1945, and 1946, 57 Stat. 242, 58 Stat. 357, 59 Stat. 196, ch. 129. The Director of the Administrative Office for United States Courts advises that as a matter of fact, more than three law clerks are serving district judges in several of the circuits at the present time.
Consequently the limitation is omitted from this section.

§753. Reporters

(a) Each district court of the United States, the United States District Court for the District of the Canal Zone, the District Court of Guam, and the District Court of the Virgin Islands shall appoint one or more court reporters.

The number of reporters shall be determined by the Judicial Conference of the United States.

The qualifications of such reporters shall be determined by standards formulated by the Judicial Conference.
Each reporter shall take an oath faithfully to perform the duties of his office.

Each such court, with the approval of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, may appoint additional reporters for temporary service not exceeding three months, when there is more reporting work in the district than can be performed promptly by the authorized number of reporters and the urgency is so great as to render it impracticable to obtain the approval of the Judicial Conference.

If any such court and the Judicial Conference are of the opinion that it is in the public interest that the duties of reporter should be combined with those of any other employee of the court, the Judicial Conference may authorize such a combination and fix the salary for the performance of the duties combined.

(b) Each session of the court and every other proceeding designated by rule or order of the court or by one of the judges shall be recorded verbatim by shorthand, mechanical means, electronic sound recording, or any other method, subject to regulations promulgated by the Judicial Conference and subject to the discretion and approval of the judge.
The regulations promulgated pursuant to the preceding sentence shall prescribe the types of electronic sound recording or other means which may be used.
Proceedings to be recorded under this section include (1) all proceedings in criminal cases had in open court; (2) all proceedings in other cases had in open court unless the parties with the approval of the judge shall agree specifically to the contrary; and (3) such other proceedings as a judge of the court may direct or as may be required by rule or order of court as 1 may be requested by any party to the proceeding.

The reporter or other individual designated to produce the record shall attach his official certificate to the original shorthand notes or other original records so taken and promptly file them with the clerk who shall preserve them in the public records of the court for not less than ten years.

The reporter or other individual designated to produce the record shall transcribe and certify such parts of the record of proceedings as may be required by any rule or order of court, including all arraignments, pleas, and proceedings in connection with the imposition of sentence in criminal cases unless they have been recorded by electronic sound recording as provided in this subsection and the original records so taken have been certified by him and filed with the clerk as provided in this subsection.
He shall also transcribe and certify such other parts of the record of proceedings as may be required by rule or order of court.
Upon the request of any party to any proceeding which has been so recorded who has agreed to pay the fee therefor, or of a judge of the court, the reporter or other individual designated to produce the record shall promptly transcribe the original records of the requested parts of the proceedings and attach to the transcript his official certificate, and deliver the same to the party or judge making the request.

The reporter or other designated individual shall promptly delivery to the clerk for the records of the court a certified copy of any transcript so made.

The transcript in any case certified by the reporter or other individual designated to produce the record shall be deemed prima facie a correct statement of the testimony taken and proceedings had.
No transcripts of the proceedings of the court shall be considered as official except those made from the records certified by the reporter or other individual designated to produce the record.

The original notes or other original records and the copy of the transcript in the office of the clerk shall be open during office hours to inspection by any person without charge.

(c) The reporters shall be subject to the supervision of the appointing court and the Judicial Conference in the performance of their duties, including dealings with parties requesting transcripts.

(d) The Judicial Conference shall prescribe records which shall be maintained and reports which shall be filed by the reporters.
Such records shall be inspected and audited in the same manner as the records and accounts of clerks of the district courts, and may include records showing:

(1) the quantity of transcripts prepared;

(2) the fees charged and the fees collected for transcripts;

(3) any expenses incurred by the reporters in connection with transcripts;

(4) the amount of time the reporters are in attendance upon the courts for the purpose of recording proceedings; and

(5) such other information as the Judicial Conference may require.

(e) Each reporter shall receive an annual salary to be fixed from time to time by the Judicial Conference of the United States.
All supplies shall be furnished by the reporter at his own expense.

(f) Each reporter may charge and collect fees for transcripts requested by the parties, including the United States, at rates prescribed by the court subject to the approval of the Judicial Conference.
He shall not charge a fee for any copy of a transcript delivered to the clerk for the records of court.
Fees for transcripts furnished in criminal proceedings to persons proceeding under the Criminal Justice Act (18 U.S.C. 3006A), or in habeas corpus proceedings to persons allowed to sue, defend, or appeal in forma pauperis, shall be paid by the United States out of moneys appropriated for those purposes.
Fees for transcripts furnished in proceedings brought under section 2255 of this title to persons permitted to sue or appeal in forma pauperis shall be paid by the United States out of money appropriated for that purpose if the trial judge or a circuit judge certifies that the suit or appeal is not frivolous and that the transcript is needed to decide the issue presented by the suit or appeal.
Fees for transcripts furnished in other proceedings to persons permitted to appeal in forma pauperis shall also be paid by the United States if the trial judge or a circuit judge certifies that the appeal is not frivolous (but presents a substantial question). The reporter may require any party requesting a transcript to prepay the estimated fee in advance except as to transcripts that are to be paid for by the United States.

(g) If, upon the advice of the chief judge of any district court within the circuit, the judicial council of any circuit determines that the number of court reporters provided such district court pursuant to subsection (a) of this section is insufficient to meet temporary demands and needs and that the services of additional court reporters for such district court should be provided the judges of such district court (including the senior judges thereof when such senior judges are performing substantial judicial services for such court) on a contract basis, rather than by appointment of court reporters as otherwise provided in this section, and such judicial council notifies the Director of the Administrative Office, in writing, of such determination, the Director of the Administrative Office is authorized to and shall contract, without regard to section 3709 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, as amended (41 U.S.C. 5), with any suitable person, firm, association, or corporation for the providing of court reporters to serve such district court under such terms and conditions as the Director of the Administrative Office finds, after consultation with the chief judge of the district court, will best serve the needs of such district court.

Section consolidates section 9a(a), (b), (c), (d) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and part of section 644 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to reporters.

The provisions of section 644 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions, relating to clerks and deputy clerks, were incorporated in section 751 of this title.
The provision of said section 644 fixing the salary of the reporter at $1,200 per annum was omitted as inconsistent with this section.
Certain other provisions of said section 644 were also omitted. (See reviser's note under section 751 of this title.)

Words “including the District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia, and the district courts in the territories and insular possessions” were omitted as covered by “Each district court in the United States, the District Court for the Territory of Alaska, the United States District Court for the District of the Canal Zone, and the District Court of the Virgin Islands.” (See reviser's note under section 88 of this title.) The courts in Hawaii and Puerto Rico are district courts of the United States under definitive section 451 of this title.

Words “for the performance of the duties combined” were substituted for “therefor, as provided by subsection (c) hereof, any provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding”.

Subsections (e) and (f) of this section incorporate part of the provisions of subsection 9a(c) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
The other provisions of said subsection are incorporated in sections 550 [see Prior Provisions note under that section] and 1915 of this title.

The last paragraph of subsection (b) of this section was revised to conform with the language of section 556 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., providing for inspection of books in the offices of clerks of district courts.
Such section 556 will be omitted, however, as more properly coverable by rule of court.

1966—Pub. L. 89–504, title II, §202(c), July 18, 1966, 80 Stat. 294, inserted a new salary limitation for court reporters effective the first pay period which begins on or after July 1, 1966, which reflected the respective applicable pay increases provided by section 102(a) of title I of Pub. L. 89–504 in corresponding rates of compensation for particular officers and employees of the government.

1965—Pub. L. 89–301, §12(c), Oct. 29, 1965, 79 Stat. 1122, inserted a new salary limitation for court reporters which reflected the applicable pay increases provided by section 2(a) of Pub. L. 89–301 in corresponding rates of compensation for particular government officers and employees.

§754. Receivers of property in different districts

A receiver appointed in any civil action or proceeding involving property, real, personal or mixed, situated in different districts shall, upon giving bond as required by the court, be vested with complete jurisdiction and control of all such property with the right to take possession thereof.

He shall have capacity to sue in any district without ancillary appointment, and may be sued with respect thereto as provided in section 959 of this title.

Such receiver shall, within ten days after the entry of his order of appointment, file copies of the complaint and such order of appointment in the district court for each district in which property is located.
The failure to file such copies in any district shall divest the receiver of jurisdiction and control over all such property in that district.

(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 922.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §117 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §56, 36 Stat. 1102).

Word “action” was substituted for “suit”, in view of Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Section 117 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., applied to land or other property of a fixed character lying in different States within the same circuit.
Words “property, real, personal or mixed, situated in different districts”, were inserted to broaden the scope of this section to cover all property in different districts without respect to situs “within different states within same judicial circuit”.

The revised section permits the receiver appointed by any district court to control all property of the defendant in whatever district the property is situated.
The provisions of section 117 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for divesting the receiver's jurisdiction and control of property in other districts upon disapproval by the circuit court of appeals or a judge thereof of the circuit embracing the district of appointment was omitted as unnecessary in view of sections 1292 and 2107 of this title.
Said section 1292 provides for review of the order of appointment and the directions of the reviewing court will control the receiver.

Provisions of section 117 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to process are the basis of section 1692 of this title.

Under section 117 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., failure to file copies of the complaint and order of appointment in any district where part of the property was located divested the receiver of jurisdiction over all the property except that part located in the State where the suit was brought.
This has been changed by limiting the exception to the district where the copies are not filed.
Obviously the election of the receiver not to take control of property in one district ought not to preclude his control in those districts in which he did file such copies.

Changes were made in phraseology.

§755. Criers and bailiffs

Each district judge may appoint a crier for the court in which he presides who shall perform also the duties of bailiff and messenger.
A crier may perform also the duties of law clerk if he is qualified to do so and the district judge who appointed him designates him to serve as a crier-law clerk.
A crier designated to serve as a crier-law clerk shall receive the compensation of a law clerk, but only so much of that compensation as is in excess of the compensation to which he would be entitled as a crier shall be deemed the compensation of a law clerk for the purposes of any limitation imposed by law upon the aggregate salaries of law clerks and secretaries appointed by a district judge.

Each United States marshal may employ, with the approval of the judge, not exceeding four bailiffs as the district judge may determine, to attend the court, maintain order, wait upon the grand and petit juries, and perform such other necessary duties as the judge or marshal may direct.

If the position of crier or bailiff is to be filled by the appointment of a person who has not previously served as either crier or bailiff, preference in the appointment shall be given to a person who has served in the military or naval forces of the United States in time of war and who has been honorably discharged therefrom, if in the opinion of the appointing officer such person is as well qualified as any other available person to perform to the satisfaction of the appointing officer all the duties of the position.

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§244, 248, 283a and 289 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§139, 143, 183, 36 Stat. 1136, 1142; June 10, 1921, ch. 18, §§301, 302, 310, 42 Stat. 23, 25, Mar. 3, 1933, ch. 212, title II, §19, 47 Stat. 1519; May 10, 1934, ch. 277, §512(b), 48 Stat. 759).

This section consolidates a part of sections 244 and 248 with sections 283a and 289, all of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

Provisions in section 248 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for distribution by the clerk of copies of the court's decisions is incorporated in section 415 of this title.

Certain provisions of section 244 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to the bailiff and the chief messenger of the Court of Claims, and powers and duties of the clerk, his deputies and assistants, are incorporated in sections 795 and 956 of this title.

A provision in section 244 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to the oath of the clerk of such court was omitted as covered by section 951 of this title.

Word “clerk” was substituted for “chief clerk” to harmonize with such designation of clerks of all other courts.

Provision that such officers shall be under the direction of the court in the performance of their duties was omitted as superfluous.

Provision in section 244 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the clerk and assistant shall be subject to removal by the Court was substituted for the grounds of misconduct or incapacity.
This change is in harmony with like provisions as to the clerks of other courts.

Section 289 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., required the Attorney General to duplicate the reporting to Congress of judgments which are furnished by the clerk.
The revised section eliminates such duplication by requiring the clerk to transmit the information to Congress.

Words “Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts” were substituted for “Attorney General,” in view of the act of August 7, 1939, ch. 501, §6, 53 Stat. 1226, 28 U.S.C., 1940 ed., following §446.

As revised, this section is consistent with similar provisions as to clerks of district courts and the courts of appeals in chapters 47 and 49 of this title.

Changes in phraseology were made.

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §244 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §139, 36 Stat. 1136).

The provision in section 244 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the bailiff should serve 4 years unless sooner removed by the court for cause, was changed by omitting the 4-year tenure and removal “for cause” requirement.
As revised this section conforms with sections relating to the similar court officers.

Term “chief messenger” in section 244 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., was changed to “messenger” as the court has but one messenger.

A provision of section 244 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., providing for appointment of a clerk and assistant is incorporated in section 791 of this title, and a provision thereof, relating to powers and duties of the clerk, his deputies and assistants, is incorporated in section 956 of this title.

This and other administrative powers of the Department of Justice with respect to the courts were transferred to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts by section 446 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which is section 604 of this title.
The revised section vests the power of appointment in the chief judge to conform with section 253 of this title and rules 5 and 22 of the Rules of the Customs Court adopted May 29, 1936.

Changes were made in phraseology.

So help me God.”

(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 925.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §512 (R.S., §794; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §291, 36 Stat. 1167).

Section 512 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., applied only to the Clerk of the Supreme Court and clerks and deputies of the district courts.

This section is applicable to the Supreme Court and to all courts established by act of Congress.

The last sentence of section 512 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., reading “The words ‘So help me God.’ shall be omitted in all cases where an affirmation is admitted instead of an oath,” was omitted as unnecessary because on affirmation such words would not be included.
As revised, the section conforms with section 453 of this title providing for the form of judicial oath.

Minor changes were made in phraseology.

(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 926.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§264, 523 and 525, section 1114(a) of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Internal Revenue Code, and District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., §11–402 (R.S. §799; May 28, 1896, ch. 252, §19, 29 Stat. 184; Mar. 2, 1901, ch. 814, 31 Stat. 956; Mar. 3, 1901, ch. 854, §178, 31 Stat. 1219; June 30, 1902, ch. 1329, 32 Stat. 527; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§158, 291, 36 Stat. 1139, 1167; Feb. 10, 1939, ch. 2, §1114(a), 53 Stat. 160; Oct. 21, 1942, ch. 619, title V, §504(a)(c), 56 Stat. 957; Feb. 25, 1944, ch. 63, title V, §503, 58 Stat. 72).

This section consolidates a part of section 525, sections 264 and 523 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., part of section 1114(a) of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., section 11–402 of the District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed.,

As respects acknowledgments, sections 264, 523 and 525 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and section 11–402 of District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., referred only to the Court of Claims and the District Court for the District of Columbia.
However, section 555 of said title 28, before amendment in 1944, provided for the collection of a fee by district court clerks for taking acknowledgments.
The 1944 amendment provided for the fixing of fees by the Judicial Conference of the United States.
If notaries and other minor officials may take acknowledgments there seems to be no reason why clerks of Federal courts and their deputies should not have such power.

Words “Except as provided in section 591 of this title,” in section 525 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted.
Under such section 591, the provisions of such section 525 were inapplicable to the Territory of Alaska, but a later act of June 6, 1900, ch. 786, §7, 31 Stat. 324, section 106 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions, provided that clerks of the District Court for Alaska should perform the duties required or authorized to be performed by clerks of United States courts in other districts.

Provisions of section 525 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to United States commissioners are incorporated in section 637 of this title.

Provisions of section 264 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and section 1114(a) of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to administration of oaths and acknowledgments by judges, are incorporated in section 459 of this title.
For distribution of other provisions of such section 1114(a) of title 26, see Distribution Table.

Changes in phraseology were made.

§954. Death of clerk; duties of deputies

Upon the death of any clerk of court, his deputy or deputies shall execute the duties of the deceased clerk in his name until his successor is appointed and qualifies.

The compensation of a deceased clerk of the Supreme Court may be paid to his personal representatives until his successor is appointed and qualifies.

(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 926; June 6, 1972, Pub. L. 92–310, title II, §206(f), 86 Stat. 203.)

Section consolidates parts of sections 8, 222 and 327 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

Sections 8, 222 and 327 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., related only to district courts, courts of appeals and the Supreme Court, respectively.
This section applies to all Federal courts and is in conformity with section 548 [546] of this title relating to death of a United States marshal.

The provision for continuance of the salary of the clerk of the Supreme Court until his successor is appointed and qualifies was inserted to preserve existing law as declared in the unpublished opinion of Chief Justice Taft, March 23, 1932 (filed in the Department of Justice), with respect to a deceased clerk of the Supreme Court.

Other provisions of sections 8, 222 and 327 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in sections 671, 711, and 751 of this title.

§955. Practice of law restricted

The clerk of each court and his deputies and assistants shall not practice law in any court of the United States.

(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 926.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§395 and 396 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§273, 274, 36 Stat. 1164).

Section consolidates parts of sections 395 and 396 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
The remainder, relating to United States marshals and their deputies, is incorporated in section 556 of this title.

Sections 395 and 396 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., have been extended to include all clerks, deputies, and assistants.

The revised section substitutes as simpler and more appropriate, the prohibition against practice of law “in any court of the United States.” (See reviser's note under section 556 of this title.)

This section contains only a part of sections 221, 244, 304 and 305 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
The other provisions of such sections are incorporated in sections 604, 711, 831, 833, 834, 957 and 1926 of this title.

Sections 221, 244, 304 and 305 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., related to the clerks of the circuit courts of appeals, the Court of Claims and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.

The phrase “assigned to them by the court” was substituted for the indefinite provision of section 221 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the clerk of each circuit court of appeals “shall exercise the same powers and perform the same duties * * * as are exercised and performed by the clerk of the Supreme Court, so far as the same may be applicable.”

This section is new insofar as it affects the Clerk of the Supreme Court and clerks of the district courts and the Customs Court.
Existing law does not prescribe the powers and duties of those clerks.
The duties of the clerk of the Customs Court have been prescribed by the rules of such court adopted May 29, 1936.

Changes were made in phraseology.

§957. Clerks ineligible for certain offices

Section consolidates section 127 with part of 304 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

Provisions of section 304 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to appointment, powers, duties, and compensation of the clerk of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, and table of fees are incorporated in sections 604, 831, 956 and 1926 of this title.

§991. United States Sentencing Commission; establishment and purposes

(a) There is established as an independent commission in the judicial branch of the United States a United States Sentencing Commission which shall consist of seven voting members and one nonvoting member.
The President, after consultation with representatives of judges, prosecuting attorneys, defense attorneys, law enforcement officials, senior citizens, victims of crime, and others interested in the criminal justice process, shall appoint the voting members of the Commission, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, one of whom shall be appointed, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, as the Chair and three of whom shall be designated by the President as Vice Chairs.
At least three of the members shall be Federal judges selected after considering a list of six judges recommended to the President by the Judicial Conference of the United States.
Not more than four of the members of the Commission shall be members of the same political party, and of the three Vice Chairs, no more than two shall be members of the same political party.
The Attorney General, or the Attorney General's designee, shall be an ex officio, nonvoting member of the Commission.
The Chair, Vice Chairs, and members of the Commission shall be subject to removal from the Commission by the President only for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office or for other good cause shown.

(b) The purposes of the United States Sentencing Commission are to—

(1) establish sentencing policies and practices for the Federal criminal justice system that—

(A) assure the meeting of the purposes of sentencing as set forth in section 3553(a)(2) of title 18, United States Code;

(B) provide certainty and fairness in meeting the purposes of sentencing, avoiding unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar criminal conduct while maintaining sufficient flexibility to permit individualized sentences when warranted by mitigating or aggravating factors not taken into account in the establishment of general sentencing practices; and

(C) reflect, to the extent practicable, advancement in knowledge of human behavior as it relates to the criminal justice process; and

(2) develop means of measuring the degree to which the sentencing, penal, and correctional practices are effective in meeting the purposes of sentencing as set forth in section 3553(a)(2) of title 18, United States Code.

(a) The Commission, by affirmative vote of at least four members of the Commission, and pursuant to its rules and regulations and consistent with all pertinent provisions of this title and title 18, United States Code, shall promulgate and distribute to all courts of the United States and to the United States Probation System—

(E) a determination under paragraphs (6) and (11) of section 3563(b) of title 18;

(A) the sanctions set forth in sections 3554, 3555, and 3556 of title 18;

(B) the conditions of probation and supervised release set forth in sections 3563(b) and 3583(d) of title 18;

(C) the sentence modification provisions set forth in sections 3563(c), 3564, 3573, and 3582(c) of title 18;

(F) the temporary release provisions set forth in section 3622 of title 18, and the prerelease custody provisions set forth in section 3624(c) of title 18; and

(3) guidelines or general policy statements regarding the appropriate use of the provisions for revocation of probation set forth in section 3565 of title 18, and the provisions for modification of the term or conditions of supervised release and revocation of supervised release set forth in section 3583(e) of title 18.

(b)(1) The Commission, in the guidelines promulgated pursuant to subsection (a)(1), shall, for each category of offense involving each category of defendant, establish a sentencing range that is consistent with all pertinent provisions of title 18, United States Code.

(2) If a sentence specified by the guidelines includes a term of imprisonment, the maximum of the range established for such a term shall not exceed the minimum of that range by more than the greater of 25 percent or 6 months, except that, if the minimum term of the range is 30 years or more, the maximum may be life imprisonment.

(c) The Commission, in establishing categories of offenses for use in the guidelines and policy statements governing the imposition of sentences of probation, a fine, or imprisonment, governing the imposition of other authorized sanctions, governing the size of a fine or the length of a term of probation, imprisonment, or supervised release, and governing the conditions of probation, supervised release, or imprisonment, shall consider whether the following matters, among others, have any relevance to the nature, extent, place of service, or other incidents 1 of an appropriate sentence, and shall take them into account only to the extent that they do have relevance—

(1) the grade of the offense;

(2) the circumstances under which the offense was committed which mitigate or aggravate the seriousness of the offense;

(3) the nature and degree of the harm caused by the offense, including whether it involved property, irreplaceable property, a person, a number of persons, or a breach of public trust;

(4) the community view of the gravity of the offense;

(5) the public concern generated by the offense;

(6) the deterrent effect a particular sentence may have on the commission of the offense by others; and

(7) the current incidence of the offense in the community and in the Nation as a whole.

(d) The Commission in establishing categories of defendants for use in the guidelines and policy statements governing the imposition of sentences of probation, a fine, or imprisonment, governing the imposition of other authorized sanctions, governing the size of a fine or the length of a term of probation, imprisonment, or supervised release, and governing the conditions of probation, supervised release, or imprisonment, shall consider whether the following matters, among others, with respect to a defendant, have any relevance to the nature, extent, place of service, or other incidents 1 of an appropriate sentence, and shall take them into account only to the extent that they do have relevance—

(1) age;

(2) education;

(3) vocational skills;

(4) mental and emotional condition to the extent that such condition mitigates the defendant's culpability or to the extent that such condition is otherwise plainly relevant;

(5) physical condition, including drug dependence;

(6) previous employment record;

(7) family ties and responsibilities;

(8) community ties;

(9) role in the offense;

(10) criminal history; and

(11) degree of dependence upon criminal activity for a livelihood.

The Commission shall assure that the guidelines and policy statements are entirely neutral as to the race, sex, national origin, creed, and socioeconomic status of offenders.

(e) The Commission shall assure that the guidelines and policy statements, in recommending a term of imprisonment or length of a term of imprisonment, reflect the general inappropriateness of considering the education, vocational skills, employment record, family ties and responsibilities, and community ties of the defendant.

(f) The Commission, in promulgating guidelines pursuant to subsection (a)(1), shall promote the purposes set forth in section 991(b)(1), with particular attention to the requirements of subsection 991(b)(1)(B) for providing certainty and fairness in sentencing and reducing unwarranted sentence disparities.

(g) The Commission, in promulgating guidelines pursuant to subsection (a)(1) to meet the purposes of sentencing as set forth in section 3553(a)(2) of title 18, United States Code, shall take into account the nature and capacity of the penal, correctional, and other facilities and services available, and shall make recommendations concerning any change or expansion in the nature or capacity of such facilities and services that might become necessary as a result of the guidelines promulgated pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.
The sentencing guidelines prescribed under this chapter shall be formulated to minimize the likelihood that the Federal prison population will exceed the capacity of the Federal prisons, as determined by the Commission.

(h) The Commission shall assure that the guidelines specify a sentence to a term of imprisonment at or near the maximum term authorized for categories of defendants in which the defendant is eighteen years old or older and—

(1) has been convicted of a felony that is—

(A) a crime of violence; or

(B) an offense described in section 401 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 841), sections 1002(a), 1005, and 1009 of the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 952(a), 955, and 959), and the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (46 U.S.C. App. 1901 et seq.); and

(2) has previously been convicted of two or more prior felonies, each of which is—

(A) a crime of violence; or

(B) an offense described in section 401 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 841), sections 1002(a), 1005, and 1009 of the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 952(a), 955, and 959), and the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (46 U.S.C. App. 1901 et seq.).

(i) The Commission shall assure that the guidelines specify a sentence to a substantial term of imprisonment for categories of defendants in which the defendant—

(1) has a history of two or more prior Federal, State, or local felony convictions for offenses committed on different occasions;

(2) committed the offense as part of a pattern of criminal conduct from which the defendant derived a substantial portion of the defendant's income;

(3) committed the offense in furtherance of a conspiracy with three or more persons engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity in which the defendant participated in a managerial or supervisory capacity;

(4) committed a crime of violence that constitutes a felony while on release pending trial, sentence, or appeal from a Federal, State, or local felony for which he was ultimately convicted; or

(5) committed a felony that is set forth in section 401 or 1010 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 841 and 960), and that involved trafficking in a substantial quantity of a controlled substance.

(j) The Commission shall insure that the guidelines reflect the general appropriateness of imposing a sentence other than imprisonment in cases in which the defendant is a first offender who has not been convicted of a crime of violence or an otherwise serious offense, and the general appropriateness of imposing a term of imprisonment on a person convicted of a crime of violence that results in serious bodily injury.

(k) The Commission shall insure that the guidelines reflect the inappropriateness of imposing a sentence to a term of imprisonment for the purpose of rehabilitating the defendant or providing the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment.

(l) The Commission shall insure that the guidelines promulgated pursuant to subsection (a)(1) reflect—

(1) the appropriateness of imposing an incremental penalty for each offense in a case in which a defendant is convicted of—

(A) multiple offenses committed in the same course of conduct that result in the exercise of ancillary jurisdiction over one or more of the offenses; and

(B) multiple offenses committed at different times, including those cases in which the subsequent offense is a violation of section 3146 (penalty for failure to appear) or is committed while the person is released pursuant to the provisions of section 3147 (penalty for an offense committed while on release) of title 18; and

(2) the general inappropriateness of imposing consecutive terms of imprisonment for an offense of conspiring to commit an offense or soliciting commission of an offense and for an offense that was the sole object of the conspiracy or solicitation.

(m) The Commission shall insure that the guidelines reflect the fact that, in many cases, current sentences do not accurately reflect the seriousness of the offense.
This will require that, as a starting point in its development of the initial sets of guidelines for particular categories of cases, the Commission ascertain the average sentences imposed in such categories of cases prior to the creation of the Commission, and in cases involving sentences to terms of imprisonment, the length of such terms actually served.
The Commission shall not be bound by such average sentences, and shall independently develop a sentencing range that is consistent with the purposes of sentencing described in section 3553(a)(2) of title 18, United States Code.

(n) The Commission shall assure that the guidelines reflect the general appropriateness of imposing a lower sentence than would otherwise be imposed, including a sentence that is lower than that established by statute as a minimum sentence, to take into account a defendant's substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.

(o) The Commission periodically shall review and revise, in consideration of comments and data coming to its attention, the guidelines promulgated pursuant to the provisions of this section.
In fulfilling its duties and in exercising its powers, the Commission shall consult with authorities on, and individual and institutional representatives of, various aspects of the Federal criminal justice system.
The United States Probation System, the Bureau of Prisons, the Judicial Conference of the United States, the Criminal Division of the United States Department of Justice, and a representative of the Federal Public Defenders shall submit to the Commission any observations, comments, or questions pertinent to the work of the Commission whenever they believe such communication would be useful, and shall, at least annually, submit to the Commission a written report commenting on the operation of the Commission's guidelines, suggesting changes in the guidelines that appear to be warranted, and otherwise assessing the Commission's work.

(p) The Commission, at or after the beginning of a regular session of Congress, but not later than the first day of May, may promulgate under subsection (a) of this section and submit to Congress amendments to the guidelines and modifications to previously submitted amendments that have not taken effect, including modifications to the effective dates of such amendments.
Such an amendment or modification shall be accompanied by a statement of the reasons therefor and shall take effect on a date specified by the Commission, which shall be no earlier than 180 days after being so submitted and no later than the first day of November of the calendar year in which the amendment or modification is submitted, except to the extent that the effective date is revised or the amendment is otherwise modified or disapproved by Act of Congress.

(q) The Commission and the Bureau of Prisons shall submit to Congress an analysis and recommendations concerning maximum utilization of resources to deal effectively with the Federal prison population.
Such report shall be based upon consideration of a variety of alternatives, including—

(1) modernization of existing facilities;

(2) inmate classification and periodic review of such classification for use in placing inmates in the least restrictive facility necessary to ensure adequate security; and

(3) use of existing Federal facilities, such as those currently within military jurisdiction.

(r) The Commission, not later than two years after the initial set of sentencing guidelines promulgated under subsection (a) goes into effect, and thereafter whenever it finds it advisable, shall recommend to the Congress that it raise or lower the grades, or otherwise modify the maximum penalties, of those offenses for which such an adjustment appears appropriate.

(s) The Commission shall give due consideration to any petition filed by a defendant requesting modification of the guidelines utilized in the sentencing of such defendant, on the basis of changed circumstances unrelated to the defendant, including changes in—

(1) the community view of the gravity of the offense;

(2) the public concern generated by the offense; and

(3) the deterrent effect particular sentences may have on the commission of the offense by others.

(t) The Commission, in promulgating general policy statements regarding the sentencing modification provisions in section 3582(c)(1)(A) of title 18, shall describe what should be considered extraordinary and compelling reasons for sentence reduction, including the criteria to be applied and a list of specific examples.
Rehabilitation of the defendant alone shall not be considered an extraordinary and compelling reason.

(u) If the Commission reduces the term of imprisonment recommended in the guidelines applicable to a particular offense or category of offenses, it shall specify in what circumstances and by what amount the sentences of prisoners serving terms of imprisonment for the offense may be reduced.

(v) The Commission shall ensure that the general policy statements promulgated pursuant to subsection (a)(2) include a policy limiting consecutive terms of imprisonment for an offense involving a violation of a general prohibition and for an offense involving a violation of a specific prohibition encompassed within the general prohibition.

(w) The appropriate judge or officer shall submit to the Commission in connection with each sentence imposed (other than a sentence imposed for a petty offense, as defined in title 18, for which there is no applicable sentencing guideline) a written report of the sentence, the offense for which it is imposed, the age, race, and sex of the offender, information regarding factors made relevant by the guidelines, and such other information as the Commission finds appropriate.
The Commission shall submit to Congress at least annually an analysis of these reports and any recommendations for legislation that the Commission concludes is warranted by that analysis.

(x) The provisions of section 553 of title 5, relating to publication in the Federal Register and public hearing procedure, shall apply to the promulgation of guidelines pursuant to this section.

(y) The Commission, in promulgating guidelines pursuant to subsection (a)(1), may include, as a component of a fine, the expected costs to the Government of any imprisonment, supervised release, or probation sentence that is ordered.

“SEC. 2. REDUCTION OF SENTENCING DISPARITY.

“(a) Recommendations.—

“(1) In general.—The United States Sentencing Commission shall submit to Congress recommendations (and an explanation therefor), regarding changes to the statutes and sentencing guidelines governing sentences for unlawful manufacturing, importing, exporting, and trafficking of cocaine, and like offenses, including unlawful possession, possession with intent to commit any of the forgoing [sic] offenses, and attempt and conspiracy to commit any of the forgoing [sic] offenses.
The recommendations shall reflect the following considerations—

“(A) the sentence imposed for trafficking in a quantity of crack cocaine should generally exceed the sentence imposed for trafficking in a like quantity of powder cocaine;

“(B) high-level wholesale cocaine traffickers, organizers, and leaders, of criminal activities should generally receive longer sentences than low-level retail cocaine traffickers and those who played a minor or minimal role in such criminal activity;

“(C) if the Government establishes that a defendant who traffics in powder cocaine has knowledge that such cocaine will be converted into crack cocaine prior to its distribution to individual users, the defendant should be treated at sentencing as though the defendant had trafficked in crack cocaine; and

“(D) an enhanced sentence should generally be imposed on a defendant who, in the course of an offense described in this subsection—

“(i) murders or causes serious bodily injury to an individual;

“(ii) uses a dangerous weapon;

“(iii) uses or possesses a firearm;

“(iv) involves a juvenile or a woman who the defendant knows or should know to be pregnant;

“(v) engages in a continuing criminal enterprise or commits other criminal offenses in order to facilitate his drug trafficking activities;

“(vi) knows, or should know, that he is involving an unusually vulnerable person;

“(vii) restrains a victim;

“(viii) traffics in cocaine within 500 feet of a school;

“(ix) obstructs justice;

“(x) has a significant prior criminal record; or

“(xi) is an organizer or leader of drug trafficking activities involving five or more persons.

“(2) Ratio.—The recommendations described in the preceding subsection [probably should be “paragraph”] shall propose revision of the drug quantity ratio of crack cocaine to powder cocaine under the relevant statutes and guidelines in a manner consistent with the ratios set for other drugs and consistent with the objectives set forth in section 3553(a) of title 28 [probably should be “title 18”] United States Code.

“(b) Study.—No later than May 1, 1996, the Department of Justice shall submit to the Judiciary Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives a report on the charging and plea practices of Federal prosecutors with respect to the offense of money laundering.
Such study shall include an account of the steps taken or to be taken by the Justice Department to ensure consistency and appropriateness in the use of the money laundering statute.
The Sentencing Commission shall submit to the Judiciary Committees comments on the study prepared by the Department of Justice.”

Definitions of Courts and Judges

Section 32 of act June 25, 1948, as amended by act May 24, 1949, ch. 139, §127, 63 Stat. 107, provided:

“(a) All laws of the United States in force on September 1, 1948, in which reference is made to a ‘circuit court of appeals’; ‘senior circuit judge’; ‘senior district judge’; ‘presiding judge’; ‘chief justice’, except when reference to the Chief Justice of the United States is intended; or ‘justice’, except when used with respect to a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States in his capacity as such or as a circuit justice, are hereby amended by substituting ‘court of appeals’ for ‘circuit court of appeals’; ‘chief judge of the circuit’ for ‘senior circuit judge’; ‘chief judge of the district court’ for ‘senior district judge’; ‘chief judge’ for ‘presiding judge’; ‘chief judge’ for ‘chief justice’, except when reference to the Chief Justice of the United States is intended; and ‘judge’ for ‘justice’, except when the latter term is used with respect to a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States in his capacity as such or as a circuit justice.

“(b) All laws of the United States in force on September 1, 1948, in which reference is made to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia or to the District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia are amended by substituting ‘United States District Court for the District of Columbia’ for such designations.

“(c) All laws of the United States in force on September 1, 1948, in which reference is made to the ‘Conference of Senior Circuit Judges’, or to the ‘Judicial Conference of Senior Circuit Judges’ are amended by substituting ‘Judicial Conference of the United States’ for such designations.

“(d) This section shall not be construed to amend historical references to courts or judicial offices which have no present or future application to such courts or offices.”

§1251. Original jurisdiction

(a) The Supreme Court shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction of all controversies between two or more States.

(b) The Supreme Court shall have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of:

(1) All actions or proceedings to which ambassadors, other public ministers, consuls, or vice consuls of foreign states are parties;

(2) All controversies between the United States and a State;

(3) All actions or proceedings by a State against the citizens of another State or against aliens.

(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 927; Sept. 30, 1978, Pub. L. 95–393, §8(b), 92 Stat. 810.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§341, 371(7), (8) (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§233, 256, 36 Stat. 1156, 1160; Oct. 6, 1917, ch. 97, §2, 40 Stat. 395; June 10, 1922, ch. 216, §2, 42 Stat. 635).

This section reconciles provisions of sections 341 and 371(7), (8) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with Article 3, section 2 and Amendment 11 of the Constitution.

Sections 341 and 371 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were not wholly consistent with such constitutional provisions.
Said section 341 provided that the Supreme Court should have original jurisdiction of controversies between a State and citizens of other States or aliens, whereas the 11th Amendment prohibits an action in any Federal Court against a State by citizens of another State or aliens.

The original jurisdiction conferred on the Supreme Court by Article 3, section 2, of the Constitution is not exclusive by virtue of that provision alone.
Congress may provide for or deny exclusiveness.
Ames v. Kansas, 1884, 4 S.Ct. 437, 111 U.S. 449, 28 L.Ed. 442; U.S. v. 4,450.72 Acres of Land, Clearwater County, State of Minnesota, D.C. Minn., 1939, 27 F.Supp. 167, affirmed 125 F.2d 636.

Sections 341 and 371 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., did not confer expressly exclusive jurisdiction on the Supreme Court in civil cases between States, Louisiana v. Texas, 1899, 20 S.Ct. 251, 176 U.S. 1, 44 L.Ed. 347, as has been provided in subsection (a)(1) of the revised section.
The language at the beginning of said section 341, for which said subsection has been substituted, was ambiguous and made it appear that an action by a State against the United States would be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.
However, in U.S. v. Louisiana, 1887, 8 S.Ct. 17, 123 U.S. 32, 31 L.Ed. 69, the Supreme Court, in a case appealed from the Court of Claims, held to the contrary.

So, also, in actions by the United States to condemn lands of a State or to enforce penalties for violation of a Federal statute against a State-owned utility, the United States district courts have jurisdiction.
See United States v. State of Utah, 1931, 51 S.Ct. 438, 283 U.S. 64, 75 L.Ed. 844; United States v. 4,450.72 Acres of Land, Clearwater County, State of Minnesota, D.C.Minn. 1939, 27 F.Supp. 167, affirmed 125 F.2d 636; United States v. State of California, 1936, 56 S.Ct. 421, 297 U.S. 175, 80 L.Ed. 567.

The intent of section 371(7), (8) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States should be exclusive of the courts of the States in controversies to which a State is a party, and suits against ambassadors, public ministers, consuls and vice consuls, is preserved and clarified by this section and section 1351 of this title.

The revised section preserves existing law with reference to foreign ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls.
Under subsection (a)(2) the Supreme Court has exclusive jurisdiction of actions or proceedings against the ambassadors or public ministers of other nations.

Under subsection (b)(1) the Supreme Court has original but not exclusive jurisdiction of actions or proceedings brought by such ambassadors or other public ministers or to which consuls or vice consuls of other nations are parties.

Section 1351 of this title gives to United States district courts, exclusive of the courts of the States, jurisdiction of civil actions against such consuls and vice consuls.

This section and said section 1351 of this title have no application to ambassadors, public ministers, consuls or vice consuls representing the United States.
See Milward v. McSaul, D.C.S.D.N.Y. 1846, 17 Fed.Cas.No. 9,623 and State of Ohio ex rel.
Popovici v. Alger, 1930, 50 S.Ct. 154, 280 U.S. 379, 74 L.Ed. 489.

Changes were made in phraseology.

Statutes Governing Writs of Error To Apply to Appeals

Act Jan. 31, 1928, ch. 14, §2, 45 Stat. 54, amended Apr. 26, 1928, ch. 440, 45 Stat. 466; June 25, 1948, ch. 646, §23, 62 Stat. 990, provided that “All Acts of Congress referring to writs of error shall be construed as amended to the extent necessary to substitute appeal for writ of error.” See also, notes preceding section 1 of this title.

L. 100–352, set out as a note under section 1254 of this title.

§1253. Direct appeals from decisions of three-judge courts

Except as otherwise provided by law, any party may appeal to the Supreme Court from an order granting or denying, after notice and hearing, an interlocutory or permanent injunction in any civil action, suit or proceeding required by any Act of Congress to be heard and determined by a district court of three judges.

(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 928.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§47, 47a, 380 and 380a (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§210, 266, 36 Stat. 1150, 1162; Mar. 4, 1913, ch. 160, 37 Stat. 1013; Oct. 22, 1913, ch. 32, 38, Stat. 220; Feb. 13, 1925, ch. 229, §1, 43 Stat. 938; Aug. 24, 1937, ch. 754, §3, 50 Stat. 752).

This section consolidates the provisions of sections 47, 47a, 380, and 380a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to direct appeals from decisions of three-judge courts involving orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission or holding State or Federal laws repugnant to the Constitution of the United States.

For distribution of other provisions of the sections on which this revised section is based, see Distribution Table.

The language in section 380 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., referring to restraining the enforcement or execution of an order made by an administrative board or a State officer was omitted as covered by this revised section and section 2281 of this title.

Words in section 380a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., “This section shall not be construed to be in derogation of any right of direct appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States under existing provisions of law,” were omitted as unnecessary.

Section 217 of title 7, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Agriculture, provides for a three-judge court in proceedings to suspend or restrain the enforcement of orders of the Secretary of Agriculture under the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921.

The final proviso of section 502 of title 33, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Navigation and Navigable Waters, for direct appeal in certain criminal cases for failure to alter bridges obstructing navigation, is recommended for express repeal in view of its implied repeal by section 345 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. (See U.S. v. Belt, 1943, 63 S.Ct. 1278, 319 U.S. 521, 87 L.Ed. 1559. See reviser's note under section 1252 of this title.)

Section 28 of title 15, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Commerce and Trade, and section 44 of title 49, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Transportation, are identical and provide for convening of a three-judge court to hear and determine civil cases arising under the Sherman anti-trust law and the Interstate Commerce Act, respectively, wherein the United States is plaintiff and when the Attorney General deems such cases of general public importance.

Section 401(d) of title 47, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Telegraphs, Telephones, and Radiotelegraphs, made the provisions of sections 28 and 29 of title 15, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Commerce and Trade, sections 44 and 45 of title 49, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Transportation, and section 345(1) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to three-judge courts and direct appeals, applicable to orders of the Federal Communications Commission enforcing the Communications Act of 1934.

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§346 and 347 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§239, 240, 36 Stat. 1157; Feb. 13, 1925, ch. 229, §1, 43 Stat. 938; Jan. 31, 1928, ch. 14, §1, 45 Stat. 54; June 7, 1934, ch. 426, 48 Stat. 926).

Section consolidates sections 346 and 347 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

Words “or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia” and “or of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia” in sections 346 and 347 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted. (See section 41 of this title.)

The prefatory words of this section preceding paragraph (1) were substituted for subsection (c) of said section 347.

The revised section omits the words of section 347 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., “and with like effect as if the case had been brought there with unrestricted appeal”, and the words of section 346 of such title “in the same manner as if it had been brought there by appeal”. The effect of subsections (1) and (3) of the revised section is to preserve existing law and retain the power of unrestricted review of cases certified or brought up on certiorari.
Only in subsection (2) is review restricted.

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §344 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§236, 237, 36 Stat. 1156; Dec. 23, 1914, ch. 2, 38 Stat. 790; Sept. 6, 1916, ch. 448, §2, 39 Stat. 726; Feb. 17, 1922, ch. 54, 42 Stat. 366; Feb. 13, 1925, ch. 229, §1, 43 Stat. 937; Jan. 31, 1928, ch. 14, §1, 45 Stat. 54).

Provisions of section 344 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to procedure for review of decisions of State courts are incorporated in section 2103 of this title.
Other provisions of such section 344 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in section 2106 of this title.

The revised section applies in both civil and criminal cases.
In Twitchell v. Philadelphia, 1868, 7 Wall. 321, 19 L.Ed. 223, it was expressly held that the provisions of section 25 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 85, on which title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §344, is based, applied to criminal cases, and many other Supreme Court decisions impliedly involve the same holding inasmuch as the Court has taken jurisdiction of criminal cases on appeal from State courts.
See, for example, Herndon v. Georgia, 1935, 55 S.Ct. 794, 295 U.S. 441, 79 L.Ed. 1530 and Ashcraft v. Tennessee, 1944, 64 S.Ct. 921, 322 U.S. 143, 88 L.Ed. 1192.

Provision, in section 344(b) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for review and determination on certiorari “with the same power and authority and with like effect as if brought up by appeal” was omitted as unnecessary.
The scope of review under this section is unrestricted.

Words “and the power to review under this paragraph may be exercised as well where the Federal claim is sustained as where it is denied,” in said section 344(b), were omitted as surplusage.

The last sentence in said section 344(b) relating to the right to relief under both subsections of said section 344, was omitted as unnecessary.

Changes were made in phraseology.

§1292. Interlocutory decisions

(a) Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this section, the courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from:

(1) Interlocutory orders of the district courts of the United States, the United States District Court for the District of the Canal Zone, the District Court of Guam, and the District Court of the Virgin Islands, or of the judges thereof, granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions, except where a direct review may be had in the Supreme Court;

(2) Interlocutory orders appointing receivers, or refusing orders to wind up receiverships or to take steps to accomplish the purposes thereof, such as directing sales or other disposals of property;

(3) Interlocutory decrees of such district courts or the judges thereof determining the rights and liabilities of the parties to admiralty cases in which appeals from final decrees are allowed.

(b) When a district judge, in making in a civil action an order not otherwise appealable under this section, shall be of the opinion that such order involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation, he shall so state in writing in such order.
The Court of Appeals which would have jurisdiction of an appeal of such action may thereupon, in its discretion, permit an appeal to be taken from such order, if application is made to it within ten days after the entry of the order: Provided, however, That application for an appeal hereunder shall not stay proceedings in the district court unless the district judge or the Court of Appeals or a judge thereof shall so order.

(c) The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit shall have exclusive jurisdiction—

(1) of an appeal from an interlocutory order or decree described in subsection (a) or (b) of this section in any case over which the court would have jurisdiction of an appeal under section 1295 of this title; and

(2) of an appeal from a judgment in a civil action for patent infringement which would otherwise be appealable to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and is final except for an accounting.

(d)(1) When the chief judge of the Court of International Trade issues an order under the provisions of section 256(b) of this title, or when any judge of the Court of International Trade, in issuing any other interlocutory order, includes in the order a statement that a controlling question of law is involved with respect to which there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from that order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit may, in its discretion, permit an appeal to be taken from such order, if application is made to that Court within ten days after the entry of such order.

(2) When the chief judge of the United States Court of Federal Claims issues an order under section 798(b) of this title, or when any judge of the United States Court of Federal Claims, in issuing an interlocutory order, includes in the order a statement that a controlling question of law is involved with respect to which there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from that order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit may, in its discretion, permit an appeal to be taken from such order, if application is made to that Court within ten days after the entry of such order.

(3) Neither the application for nor the granting of an appeal under this subsection shall stay proceedings in the Court of International Trade or in the Court of Federal Claims, as the case may be, unless a stay is ordered by a judge of the Court of International Trade or of the Court of Federal Claims or by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or a judge of that court.

(4)(A) The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit shall have exclusive jurisdiction of an appeal from an interlocutory order of a district court of the United States, the District Court of Guam, the District Court of the Virgin Islands, or the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands, granting or denying, in whole or in part, a motion to transfer an action to the United States Court of Federal Claims under section 1631 of this title.

(B) When a motion to transfer an action to the Court of Federal Claims is filed in a district court, no further proceedings shall be taken in the district court until 60 days after the court has ruled upon the motion.
If an appeal is taken from the district court's grant or denial of the motion, proceedings shall be further stayed until the appeal has been decided by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
The stay of proceedings in the district court shall not bar the granting of preliminary or injunctive relief, where appropriate and where expedition is reasonably necessary.
However, during the period in which proceedings are stayed as provided in this subparagraph, no transfer to the Court of Federal Claims pursuant to the motion shall be carried out.

(e) The Supreme Court may prescribe rules, in accordance with section 2072 of this title, to provide for an appeal of an interlocutory decision to the courts of appeals that is not otherwise provided for under subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d).

L. 102–572, title I, §101, title IX, §§902(b), 906(c), 106 Stat. 4506, 4516, 4518.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§225(b), 227, 227a, and section 61 of title 7 of the Canal Zone Code (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§128, 129, 36 Stat. 1133, 1134; Feb. 13, 1925, ch. 229, §1, 43 Stat. 937; Feb. 28, 1927, ch. 228, 44 Stat. 1261; Apr. 3, 1926, ch. 102, 44 Stat. 233; May 20, 1926, ch. 347, §13(a), 44 Stat. 587; Apr. 11, 1928, ch. 354, §1, 45 Stat. 422; May 17, 1932, ch. 190, 47 Stat. 158).

Section consolidates sections 225(b), 227 and part of 227a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with necessary changes in phraseology to effect the consolidation.

The second paragraph of section 225(b) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to review of decisions of the district courts, under section 9 of the Railway Labor Act (section 159 of title 45), was omitted as covered by section 1291 of this title.

Words in section 227 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., “or decree,” after “interlocutory order,” were deleted, in view of Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, using only the word “order.”

Provisions of sections 227 and 227a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to stay of proceedings pending appeal were omitted as superseded by Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 73.

Provisions of section 227 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., requiring an additional bond by the district court as a condition of appeal were omitted in view of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 73.

Words in section 227 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., “and sections 346 and 347 of this title shall apply to such cases in the circuit courts of appeals as to other cases therein,” at the end of the first sentence of section 227 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were deleted as fully covered by section 1254 of this title, applicable to any case in a court of appeals.
Other procedural provisions of said section 227 were omitted as covered by section 2101 et seq. of this title.

In subsection (4), which is based on section 227a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., words “civil actions” were substituted for “suits in equity” and word “judgments” was substituted for “decree,” in view of Rules 2 and 54 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

The provision of sections 227 and 227a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that appeal must be taken within thirty days after entry of order, decree or judgment is incorporated in section 2107 of this title.

The provisions of section 227a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to stay of proceedings pending appeal, were omitted as superseded by Rule 73 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

The district courts for the districts of Hawaii and Puerto Rico are embraced in the term “district courts of the United States.” (See definitive section 451 of this title.) Consequently the specific reference in section 225 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., to “the United States district courts for Hawaii” was omitted.

The District Court for the District of Puerto Rico is not enumerated in section 225(b) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., nevertheless subsection (2) of the revised section does not except such court.
Thus in conformity with the last sentence of section 864, title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
For distribution of said section 864, see Distribution Table.

Section 61 of title 7 of the Canal Zone Code is also incorporated in sections 1291 and 1294 of this title.

Termination of United States District Court for the District of the Canal Zone

Section consolidates the venue provisions of sections 645, 864, 1356, and 1392 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions with sections 1141(b)(1)(2)(3) to title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Internal Revenue and sections 225(d) and 865 of said title 48. Other provisions of said section 864, not incorporated in this section and sections 41 and 119 of this title, were retained in title 48. Other provisions of said section 1356 are incorporated in section 1291 of this title.
Other provisions of said section 1392 were also retained in title 48.

Paragraph (3) of section 1141(b) of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., was omitted as executed.
It made such subsection applicable to all decisions of the Board of Tax Appeals (Tax Court) rendered on and after May 10, 1934.

Specific reference to the United States district courts for the districts of Hawaii, Puerto Rico and District of Columbia was omitted as unnecessary, these courts being embraced in the definition of “a district court of the United States” contained in section 451 of this title.

Administrative orders, referred to in reviser's note under section 1291 of this title, are reviewable and enforceable in the following circuits:

Words “wherein the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $3,000, exclusive of interest and costs,” were added to conform to rulings of the Supreme Court.
See construction of provision relating to jurisdictional amount requirement in cases involving a Federal question in United States v. Sayward, 16 S.Ct. 371, 160 U.S. 493, 40 L.Ed. 508; Fishback v. Western Union Tel.

Words “all civil actions” were substituted for “all suits of a civil nature, at common law or in equity” to conform with Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Words “or treaties” were substituted for “or treaties made, or which shall be made under their authority,” for purposes of brevity.

The remaining provisions of section 41(1) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in sections 1332, 1341, 1342, 1345, 1354, and 1359 of this title.

This section is referred to in section 1441 of this title; title 15 section 2064; title 25 section 416a; title 42 section 405; title 49 section 10709.

§1332. Diversity of citizenship; amount in controversy; costs

(a) The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and is between—

(1) citizens of different States;

(2) citizens of a State and citizens or subjects of a foreign state;

(3) citizens of different States and in which citizens or subjects of a foreign state are additional parties; and

(4) a foreign state, defined in section 1603(a) of this title, as plaintiff and citizens of a State or of different States.

For the purposes of this section, section 1335, and section 1441, an alien admitted to the United States for permanent residence shall be deemed a citizen of the State in which such alien is domiciled.

(b) Except when express provision therefor is otherwise made in a statute of the United States, where the plaintiff who files the case originally in the Federal courts is finally adjudged to be entitled to recover less than the sum or value of $50,000, computed without regard to any setoff or counterclaim to which the defendant may be adjudged to be entitled, and exclusive of interest and costs, the district court may deny costs to the plaintiff and, in addition, may impose costs on the plaintiff.

(c) For the purposes of this section and section 1441 of this title—

(1) a corporation shall be deemed to be a citizen of any State by which it has been incorporated and of the State where it has its principal place of business, except that in any direct action against the insurer of a policy or contract of liability insurance, whether incorporated or unincorporated, to which action the insured is not joined as a party-defendant, such insurer shall be deemed a citizen of the State of which the insured is a citizen, as well as of any State by which the insurer has been incorporated and of the State where it has its principal place of business; and

(2) the legal representative of the estate of a decedent shall be deemed to be a citizen only of the same State as the decedent, and the legal representative of an infant or incompetent shall be deemed to be a citizen only of the same State as the infant or incompetent.

(d) The word “States”, as used in this section, includes the Territories, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §41(1) (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §24, par. 1, 36 Stat. 1091; May 14, 1934, ch. 283, §1, 48 Stat. 775; Aug. 21, 1937, ch. 726, §1, 50 Stat. 738; Apr. 20, 1940, ch. 117, 54 Stat. 143).

Other provisions of section 41(1) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in sections 1331, 1341, 1342, 1345, 1354, and 1359 of this title. (See reviser's notes under said sections.)

Jurisdiction conferred by other sections of this chapter, except section 1335, is not dependent upon diversity of citizenship. (See annotations under former section 41 of title 28, U.S.C.A., and 35 C.J.S., p. 833 et seq. §§30–43. See, also, reviser's note under section 1331 of this title.) As to citizenship of bank where jurisdiction depends upon diversity of citizenship, see section 1348 of this title.

Words “all civil actions” were substituted for “all suits of a civil nature, at common law or in equity” in order to conform to Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Words “or citizens of the District of Columbia, Territory of Hawaii, or Alaska, and any State or Territory” which were inserted by the amendatory act April 20, 1940, are omitted.
The word “States” is defined in this section and enumeration of the references is unnecessary.

The revised section conforms with the views of Philip F. Herrick, United States Attorney, Puerto Rico, who observed that the act of April 20, 1940, permitted action between a citizen of Hawaii and of Puerto Rico, but not between a citizen of New York and Puerto Rico, in the district court.

This changes the law to insure uniformity.
The 1940 amendment applied only to the provision as to controversies between “citizens of different States.” The new definition in subsection (b) extends the 1940 amendment to apply to controversies between citizens of the Territories or the District of Columbia, and foreign states or citizens or subjects thereof.

The diversity of citizenship language of section 41(1) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., as amended in 1940, was described as ambiguous in McGarry v. City of Bethlehem, 45 F.Supp. 385, 386. In that case the 1940 amendment was held unconstitutional insofar as it affected the District of Columbia.
However, two other district courts upheld the amendment.
Winkler v. Daniels, D.C.Va. 1942, 43 F.Supp. 265; Glaeser v. Acacia Mutual Life Ass'n., D.C.Cal. 1944, 55 F.Supp. 925.

This section is intended to cover all diversity of citizenship instances in civil actions in accordance with the judicial construction of the language in the original section 41(1) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
Therefore, the revised language covers civil actions between—

Citizens of a State, and citizens of other States and foreign states or citizens or subjects thereof;

Citizens of a Territory or the District of Columbia, and foreign states or citizens or subjects thereof;

Citizens of different States;

Citizens of different Territories;

Citizens of a State, and citizens of Territories;

Citizens of a State or Territory, and citizens of the District of Columbia;

Citizens of a State, and foreign states or citizens or subjects thereof.

The revised section removes an uncertainty referred to in the McGarry case, supra, as to whether Congress intended to permit citizens of the Territories or the District of Columbia to sue a State or Territory itself rather than the citizens thereof.
The court observed that “Congress could hardly have had such intention.”

The sentence “The foregoing provisions as to the sum or value of the matter in controversy shall not be construed to apply to any of the cases mentioned in the succeeding paragraphs of this section” was omitted as unnecessary.
Those paragraphs are (2)–(28) of said section 41 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which are revised and incorporated in this chapter and, except for those relating to actions against the United States and interpleader, contains no provision as to a sum or value necessary to confer jurisdiction.
Consequently the omitted sentence is covered by excluding such requirement.

Section 41(1) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., as originally enacted, purported to include all jurisdictional provisions relating to the district courts.
Subsequently, many special jurisdictional provisions were enacted and incorporated in other titles of the U.S.C., 1940 ed., as follows:

§1333. Admiralty, maritime and prize cases

The district courts shall have original jurisdiction, exclusive of the courts of the States, of:

(1) Any civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction, saving to suitors in all cases all other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled.

(2) Any prize brought into the United States and all proceedings for the condemnation of property taken as prize.

Historical and Revision Notes

1948 Act

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§41(3) and 371 (3), (4) (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§24, par. 3, 256, pars. 3, 4, 36 Stat. 1091, 1160; Oct. 6, 1917, ch. 97, §§1, 2, 40 Stat. 395; June 10, 1922, ch. 216, §§1, 2, 42 Stat. 634).

Section consolidates certain provisions of sections 41(3), 371(3) and 371(4) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
Other provisions of sections 41(3) and 371(4), relating to seizures, are incorporated in section 1356 of this title. (See reviser's note thereunder.)

The “saving to suitors” clause in sections 41(3) and 371(3) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., was changed by substituting the words “any other remedy to which he is otherwise entitled” for the words “the right of a common law remedy where the common law is competent to give it.” The substituted language is simpler and more expressive of the original intent of Congress and is in conformity with Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure abolishing the distinction between law and equity.

Provisions of section 41(3) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., based on the 1917 and 1922 amendments, relating to remedies under State workmen's compensation laws, were deleted.
Such amendments were held unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. (See Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, 1920, 40 S.Ct. 438, 253 U.S. 149, 64 L.Ed. 834, and State of Washington v. W. C. Dawson & Co., 1924, 44 S.Ct. 302, 264 U.S. 219, 68 L.Ed. 646.)

Words “libellant or petitioner” were substituted for “suitors” to describe moving party in admiralty cases.

Changes were made in phraseology.

1949 Act

This section amends section 1333(a)(1) of title 28, U.S.C., by substituting “suitors” for “libellant or petitioner” to conform to the language of the law in existence at the time of the enactment of the revision of title 28.

§1334. Bankruptcy cases and proceedings

(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the district courts shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction of all cases under title 11.

(b) Notwithstanding any Act of Congress that confers exclusive jurisdiction on a court or courts other than the district courts, the district courts shall have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil proceedings arising under title 11, or arising in or related to cases under title 11.

(c)(1) Nothing in this section prevents a district court in the interest of justice, or in the interest of comity with State courts or respect for State law, from abstaining from hearing a particular proceeding arising under title 11 or arising in or related to a case under title 11.

(2) Upon timely motion of a party in a proceeding based upon a State law claim or State law cause of action, related to a case under title 11 but not arising under title 11 or arising in a case under title 11, with respect to which an action could not have been commenced in a court of the United States absent jurisdiction under this section, the district court shall abstain from hearing such proceeding if an action is commenced, and can be timely adjudicated, in a State forum of appropriate jurisdiction.

(d) Any decision to abstain or not to abstain made under this subsection 1 (other than a decision not to abstain in a proceeding described in subsection (c)(2)) is not reviewable by appeal or otherwise by the court of appeals under section 158(d), 1291, or 1292 of this title or by the Supreme Court of the United States under section 1254 of this title.
This subsection 1 shall not be construed to limit the applicability of the stay provided for by section 362 of title 11, United States Code, as such section applies to an action affecting the property of the estate in bankruptcy.

(e) The district court in which a case under title 11 is commenced or is pending shall have exclusive jurisdiction of all of the property, wherever located, of the debtor as of the commencement of such case, and of property of the estate.

(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 931; Nov. 6, 1978, Pub. L. 95–598, title II, §238(a), 92 Stat. 2667; July 10, 1984, Pub. L. 98–353, title I, §101(a), 98 Stat. 333; Oct. 27, 1986, Pub.

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§41(19) and 371(6) (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§24, par. 19, 256, par. 6, 36 Stat. 1093, 1160).

Changes in phraseology were made.

Jurisdiction Over and Transfer of Bankruptcy Cases and Proceedings

Section 115 of Pub. L. 98–353 provided that:

“(a) On the date of the enactment of this Act [July 10, 1984] the appropriate district court of the United States shall have jurisdiction of—

“(1) cases, and matters and proceedings in cases, under the Bankruptcy Act [former Title 11, Bankruptcy] that are pending immediately before such date in the bankruptcy courts continued by section 404(a) of the Act of November 6, 1978 (Public Law 95–598; 92 Stat. 2687) [formerly set out as a note preceding section 151 of this title], and

“(2) cases under title 11 of the United States Code, and proceedings arising under title 11 of the United States Code or arising in or related to cases under title 11 of the United States Code, that are pending immediately before such date in the bankruptcy courts continued by section 404(a) of the Act of November 6, 1978 (Public Law 95–598; 92 Stat. 2687).

“(b) On the date of the enactment of this Act [July 10, 1984], there shall be transferred to the appropriate district court of the United States appeals from final judgments, orders, and decrees of the bankruptcy courts pending immediately before such date in the bankruptcy appellate panels appointed under section 405(c) of the Act of November 6, 1978 (Public Law 95–598; 92 Stat. 2685) [formerly set out as a note preceding section 1471 of this title].”

Section Referred to in Other Sections

This section is referred to in sections 156, 157, 1452 of this title.

1 So in original.
Probably should be a reference to subsection (c). See 1994 Amendment note below.

§1335. Interpleader

(a) The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action of interpleader or in the nature of interpleader filed by any person, firm, or corporation, association, or society having in his or its custody or possession money or property of the value of $500 or more, or having issued a note, bond, certificate, policy of insurance, or other instrument of value or amount of $500 or more, or providing for the delivery or payment or the loan of money or property of such amount or value, or being under any obligation written or unwritten to the amount of $500 or more, if

(1) Two or more adverse claimants, of diverse citizenship as defined in section 1332 of this title, are claiming or may claim to be entitled to such money or property, or to any one or more of the benefits arising by virtue of any note, bond, certificate, policy or other instrument, or arising by virtue of any such obligation; and if (2) the plaintiff has deposited such money or property or has paid the amount of or the loan or other value of such instrument or the amount due under such obligation into the registry of the court, there to abide the judgment of the court, or has given bond payable to the clerk of the court in such amount and with such surety as the court or judge may deem proper, conditioned upon the compliance by the plaintiff with the future order or judgment of the court with respect to the subject matter of the controversy.

(b) Such an action may be entertained although the titles or claims of the conflicting claimants do not have a common origin, or are not identical, but are adverse to and independent of one another.

(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 931.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §41(26) (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §24, par. 26, as added Jan. 20, 1936, ch. 13, §1, 49 Stat. 1096).

Words “civil action” were substituted for “suits in equity”; word “plaintiff” was substituted for “complainant”; and word “judgment” was substituted for “decree,” in order to make the language of this section conform with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

The words “duly verified” following “in the nature of interpleader,” near the beginning of the section, were omitted.
Under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure pleadings are no longer required to be verified or accompanied by affidavit unless specially required by statute.
Although verification was specially required by section 41(26) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., the need therefor is not apparent.

Provisions of section 41(26)(b) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to venue are the basis of section 1397 of this title. (See, also, reviser's note under said section.)

Subsections (c) and (d) of said section 41(26) relating to issuance of injunctions constitute section 2361 of this title. (See reviser's note under said section.)

Subsection (e) of such section 41(26), relating to defense in nature of interpleader and joinder of additional parties, was omitted as unnecessary, such matters being governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Changes were made in phraseology.

§1336. Surface Transportation Board's orders

(a) Except as otherwise provided by Act of Congress, the district courts shall have jurisdiction of any civil action to enforce, in whole or in part, any order of the Surface Transportation Board, and to enjoin or suspend, in whole or in part, any order of the Surface Transportation Board for the payment of money or the collection of fines, penalties, and forfeitures.

(b) When a district court or the United States Court of Federal Claims refers a question or issue to the Surface Transportation Board for determination, the court which referred the question or issue shall have exclusive jurisdiction of a civil action to enforce, enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend, in whole or in part, any order of the Surface Transportation Board arising out of such referral.

(c) Any action brought under subsection (b) of this section shall be filed within 90 days from the date that the order of the Surface Transportation Board becomes final.

(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 931; Aug. 30, 1964, Pub. L. 88–513, §1, 78 Stat. 695; Jan. 2, 1975, Pub. L. 93–584, §1, 88 Stat. 1917; Apr. 2, 1982, Pub. L. 97–164, title I, §128, 96 Stat. 39; Oct. 29, 1992, Pub. L. 102–572, title IX, §902(b)(1), 106 Stat. 4516; Dec. 29, 1995, Pub. L. 104–88, title III, §305(a)(1), (2), 109 Stat. 944.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §41(27), (28) (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§24(27), (28), 207, 36 Stat. 1091, 1148; Oct. 22, 1913, ch. 32, 38 Stat. 219).

Words “Except as otherwise provided by enactment of Congress” were inserted because of certain similar cases of which the courts of appeals are given jurisdiction. (See, for example, section 21 of title 15, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Commerce and Trade.)

Words “any civil action” were substituted for “all cases” and “cases” in view of Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Changes were made in phraseology.

§1337. Commerce and antitrust regulations; amount in controversy, costs

(a) The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action or proceeding arising under any Act of Congress regulating commerce or protecting trade and commerce against restraints and monopolies: Provided, however, That the district courts shall have original jurisdiction of an action brought under section 11706 or 14706 of title 49, only if the matter in controversy for each receipt or bill of lading exceeds $10,000, exclusive of interest and costs.

(b) Except when express provision therefor is otherwise made in a statute of the United States, where a plaintiff who files the case under section 11706 or 14706 of title 49, originally in the Federal courts is finally adjudged to be entitled to recover less than the sum or value of $10,000, computed without regard to any setoff or counterclaim to which the defendant may be adjudged to be entitled, and exclusive of any interest and costs, the district court may deny costs to the plaintiff and, in addition, may impose costs on the plaintiff.

(c) The district courts shall not have jurisdiction under this section of any matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of International Trade under chapter 95 of this title.

(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 931; Oct. 20, 1978, Pub. L. 95–486, §9(a), 92 Stat. 1633; Oct. 10, 1980, Pub. L. 96–417, title V, §505, 94 Stat. 1743; Jan. 12, 1983, Pub. L. 97–449, §5(f), 96 Stat. 2442; Dec. 29, 1995, Pub. L. 104–88, title III, §305(a)(3), 109 Stat. 944.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §41(8), (23) (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §24, pars. 8, 23, 36 Stat. 1092, 1093; Oct. 22, 1913, ch. 32, 38 Stat. 219).

Words “civil action” were substituted for “suits”, in view of Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Changes were made in phraseology.

This section is referred to in title 41 sections 607, 609; title 49 section 10709.

§1338. Patents, plant variety protection, copyrights, mask works, trade-marks, and unfair competition

(a) The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents, plant variety protection, copyrights and trade-marks.
Such jurisdiction shall be exclusive of the courts of the states in patent, plant variety protection and copyright cases.

(b) The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action asserting a claim of unfair competition when joined with a substantial and related claim under the copyright, patent, plant variety protection or trade-mark laws.

(c) Subsections (a) and (b) apply to exclusive rights in mask works under chapter 9 of title 17 to the same extent as such subsections apply to copyrights.

(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 931; Dec. 24, 1970, Pub. L. 91–577, title III, §143(b), 84 Stat. 1559; Nov. 19, 1988, Pub. L. 100–702, title X, §1020(a)(4), 102 Stat. 4671.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§41(7) and 371(5) (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§24, par. 7, 256, par. 5, 36 Stat. 1092, 1160).

Section consolidates section 41(7) with section 371 (5) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with necessary changes in phraseology.

Words “of any civil action” were substituted for “all suits at law or in equity” and “cases” to conform section to Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Word “patents” was substituted for “patent-right” in said section 371 (Fifth) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

Similar provisions respecting suits cognizable in district courts, including those of territories and possessions. (See section 34 of title 17, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Copyrights.)

Subsection (b) is added and is intended to avoid “piecemeal” litigation to enforce common-law and statutory copyright, patent, and trade-mark rights by specifically permitting such enforcement in a single civil action in the district court.
While this is the rule under Federal decisions, this section would enact it as statutory authority.
The problem is discussed at length in Hurn v. Oursler (1933, 53 S.Ct. 586, 289 U.S. 238, 77 L.Ed. 1148) and in Musher Foundation v. Alba Trading Co. (C.C.A. 1942, 127 F.2d 9) (majority and dissenting opinions).

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §41(5) (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §24, par. 5, 36 Stat. 1092; Mar. 2, 1929, ch. 488, §1, 45 Stat. 1475).

Words “Customs Court” were substituted for “Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.” Section 41(5) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., is based on the Judicial Code of 1911. At that time the only court, other than the district courts, having jurisdiction of customs cases, was the Court of Customs Appeals which became the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals in 1929. The Customs Court was created in 1926 as a court of original jurisdiction over customs cases. (See reviser's note preceding section 251 of this title.)

Words “any civil action” were substituted for “all cases” in view of Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Changes were made in phraseology.

Historical and Revision Notes

1948 Act

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§41(20), 931(a), 932 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §24, par. 20, 36 Stat. 1093; Nov. 23, 1921, ch. 136, §1310(c), 42 Stat. 311; June 2, 1924, ch. 234, §1025(c), 43 Stat. 348; Feb. 24, 1925, ch. 309, 43 Stat. 972; Feb. 26, 1926, ch. 27, §§1122(c), 1200, 44 Stat. 121, 125; Aug. 2, 1946, ch. 753, §§410(a), 411, 60 Stat. 843).

Section consolidates provisions of section 41(20) conferring jurisdiction upon the district court, in civil actions against the United States, with the first sentence of section 931(a) relating to jurisdiction of the district courts in tort claims cases, and those provisions of section 932 making the provisions of said section 41(20), relating to counterclaim and set-off, applicable to tort claims cases, all of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

Provision in section 931(a) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for trials without a jury, is incorporated in section 2402 of this revised title.
For other provisions thereof, see Distribution Table.

Words “commencing an action under this section” in subsec. (c) of this revised section cover the provision in section 932 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., requiring that the same provisions “for counterclaim and set-off” shall apply to tort claims cases brought in the district courts.

The phrase in section 931(a) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., “accruing on and after January 1, 1945” was omitted because executed as of the date of the enactment of this revised title.

Provisions in section 41(20) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to time for commencing action against United States and jury trial constitute sections 2401 and 2402 of this title. (See reviser's notes under said sections.)

Words in section 41(20) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., “commenced after passage of the Revenue Act of 1921” were not included in revised subsection (a)(1) because obsolete and superfluous.
Actions under this section involving erroneous or illegal assessments by the collector of taxes would be barred unless filed within the 5-year limitation period of section 1113(a) of the Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 9, 116. (See United States v. A. S. Kreider Co., 1941, 61 S.Ct. 1007, 313 U.S. 443, 85 L.Ed. 1447.)

Words in section 41(20) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., “if the collector of internal revenue is dead or is not in office at the time such action or proceeding is commenced” were omitted.

The revised section retains the language of section 41(20) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with respect to actions against the United States if the collector is dead or not in office when action is commenced, and consequently maintains the long existing distinctions in practice between actions against the United States and actions against the collector who made the assessment or collection.
In the latter class of actions either party may demand a jury trial while jury trial is denied in actions against the United States.
See section 2402 of this title.
In reality all such actions are against the United States and not against local collectors. (See Lowe v. United States, 1938, 58 S.Ct. 896, 304 U.S. 302, 82 L.Ed. 1362; Manseau v. United States, D.C.Mich. 1943, 52 F.Supp. 395, and Combined Metals Reduction Co. v. United States, D.C.Utah 1943, 53 F.Supp. 739.)

The revised subsection (c)(1) omitted clause: “but no suit pending on the 27th day of June 1898 shall abate or be affected by this provision,” contained in section 41(20) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., as obsolete and superfluous.
The words contained in section 41(20) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., “claims growing out of the Civil War, and commonly known as ‘war-claims,’ or to hear and determine other claims which had been reported adversely prior to the 3d day of March 1887 by any court, department, or commission authorized to have and determine the same,” were omitted for the same reason.

The words “in a civil action or in admiralty,” in subsection (a)(2), were substituted for “either in a court of law, equity, or admiralty” to conform to Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Words in section 41(20) “in respect to which claims the party would be entitled to redress against the United States, either in a court of law, equity, or admiralty, if the United States were suable” were omitted from subsection (a)(2) of this revised section as unnecessary.
See reviser's note under section 1491 of this title.

(See, also, Lamborn v. United States, C.C.P.A. 1939, 104 F.2d 75, certiorari denied 60 S.Ct. 115, 308 U.S. 589, 84 L.Ed. 493.)

“This Act may be cited as the ‘Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991’.

“SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF CIVIL ACTION.

“(a) Liability.—An individual who, under actual or apparent authority, or color of law, of any foreign nation—

“(1) subjects an individual to torture shall, in a civil action, be liable for damages to that individual; or

“(c) Statute of Limitations.—No action shall be maintained under this section unless it is commenced within 10 years after the cause of action arose.

“SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

“(a) Extrajudicial Killing.—For the purposes of this Act, the term ‘extrajudicial killing’ means a deliberated killing not authorized by a previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.
Such term, however, does not include any such killing that, under international law, is lawfully carried out under the authority of a foreign nation.

“(b) Torture.—For the purposes of this Act—

“(1) the term ‘torture’ means any act, directed against an individual in the offender's custody or physical control, by which severe pain or suffering (other than pain or suffering arising only from or inherent in, or incidental to, lawful sanctions), whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on that individual for such purposes as obtaining from that individual or a third person information or a confession, punishing that individual for an act that individual or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, intimidating or coercing that individual or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind; and

“(2) mental pain or suffering refers to prolonged mental harm caused by or resulting from—

“(A) the intentional infliction or threatened infliction of severe physical pain or suffering;

“(B) the administration or application, or threatened administration or application, of mind altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or the personality;

“(C) the threat of imminent death; or

“(D) the threat that another individual will imminently be subjected to death, severe physical pain or suffering, or the administration or application of mind altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or personality.”

(A) the district court for the district in which any of the acts or omissions giving rise to the forfeiture occurred, or

(B) any other district where venue for the forfeiture action or proceeding is specifically provided for in section 1395 of this title or any other statute.

(2) Whenever property subject to forfeiture under the laws of the United States is located in a foreign country, or has been detained or seized pursuant to legal process or competent authority of a foreign government, an action or proceeding for forfeiture may be brought as provided in paragraph (1), or in the United States District court 1 for the District of Columbia.

(c) In any case in which a final order disposing of property in a civil forfeiture action or proceeding is appealed, removal of the property by the prevailing party shall not deprive the court of jurisdiction.
Upon motion of the appealing party, the district court or the court of appeals shall issue any order necessary to preserve the right of the appealing party to the full value of the property at issue, including a stay of the judgment of the district court pending appeal or requiring the prevailing party to post an appeal bond.

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. §§41(1) and 80 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§24(1), 37, 36 Stat. 1091, 1098; May 14, 1934, ch. 283, §1, 48 Stat. 775; Aug. 21, 1937, ch. 726, §1, 50 Stat. 738; Apr. 20, 1940, ch. 117, 54 Stat. 143).

Provisions of section 80 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for payment of costs upon dismissal of an action for lack of jurisdiction are incorporated in section 1919 of this title.
Other provisions of said section 80 appear in section 1447 of this title.

Provisions of section 80 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for dismissal of an action not really and substantially involving a dispute or controversy within the jurisdiction of a district court, were omitted as unnecessary.
Any court will dismiss a case not within its jurisdiction when its attention is drawn to the fact, or even on its own motion.

The assignee clause in section 41(1) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., “is a jumble of legislative jargon.” (For further references to the consequences of “its obscure phraseology,” see, 35 Ill.
Law Rev., January 1941, pp. 569–571.)

The revised section changes this clause by confining its application to cases wherein the assignment is improperly or collusively made to invoke jurisdiction.
Furthermore, the difficulty of applying the original clause is overcome and the original purpose of such clause is better served by substantially following section 80 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

The assignee clause was incorporated in the original Judiciary Act of 1789. Such section 80 was enacted in 1875. The history of the assignee clause “shows clearly that its purpose and effect, at the time of its enactment were to prevent the conferring of jurisdiction on the Federal courts, on grounds of diversity of citizenship, by assignment, in cases where it would not otherwise exist.” (Sowell v. Federal Reserve Bank, 1925, 45 S.Ct. 528, 529, 268 U.S. 449, 453, 69 L.Ed. 1041, 1048.) Thus the purpose of the assignee clause was to prevent the manufacture of Federal jurisdiction by the device of assignment.
It achieves this purpose only partially.
For example, the assignee clause excepts two types of choses in action from its coverage: (1) Foreign bill of exchange; and (2) corporate bearer paper.
But this does not prevent the use of assignment of these choses in action to create the necessary diversity or alienage for jurisdictional purposes.
Such section 80 does, however, prevent that. (See Bullard v. City of Cisco, 1933, 54 S.Ct. 177, 290 U.S. 179, 78 L.Ed. 254, 93 A.L.R. 141.) Its coverage against collusive jurisdiction is unlimited, and its approach is direct.
The assignee clause, on the other hand, prevents the bona fide assignee of a chose in action within its terms from resorting to the Federal courts unless there is jurisdiction to support the assignee-plaintiff's case and a showing that there would have been jurisdiction if the assignor had brought the action in lieu of the assignee-plaintiff.
Since the assignee clause deals with the bona fide assignee, there has been much litigation to determine the assignments which should or should not be within the purview of the clause.
Thus the courts have thought it advisable to limit the term “chose in action” and exclude from its scope (1) an implied in law duty or promise, and (2) a transfer of a property interest; and to exclude an assignment by operation of law from the coverage of the clause.
Intermediate assignments and reassignment also give difficulty.

(c) Any tribal ordinance or custom heretofore or hereafter adopted by an Indian tribe, band, or community in the exercise of any authority which it may possess shall, if not inconsistent with any applicable civil law of the State, be given full force and effect in the determination of civil causes of action pursuant to this section.

(a) The United States District Court for the District of Columbia shall have original jurisdiction, without regard to the amount in controversy, over any civil action brought by the Senate or any authorized committee or subcommittee of the Senate to enforce, to secure a declaratory judgment concerning the validity of, or to prevent a threatened refusal or failure to comply with, any subpena or order issued by the Senate or committee or subcommittee of the Senate to any entity acting or purporting to act under color or authority of State law or to any natural person to secure the production of documents or other materials of any kind or the answering of any deposition or interrogatory or to secure testimony or any combination thereof.
This section shall not apply to an action to enforce, to secure a declaratory judgment concerning the validity of, or to prevent a threatened refusal to comply with, any subpena or order issued to an officer or employee of the Federal Government acting within his official capacity.

(b) Upon application by the Senate or any authorized committee or subcommittee of the Senate, the district court shall issue an order to an entity or person refusing, or failing to comply with, or threatening to refuse or not to comply with, a subpena or order of the Senate or committee or subcommittee of the Senate requiring such entity or person to comply forthwith.
Any refusal or failure to obey a lawful order of the district court issued pursuant to this section may be held by such court to be a contempt thereof.
A contempt proceeding shall be commenced by an order to show cause before the court why the entity or person refusing or failing to obey the court order should not be held in contempt of court.
Such contempt proceeding shall be tried by the court and shall be summary in manner.
The purpose of sanctions imposed as a result of such contempt proceeding shall be to compel obedience to the order of the court.
Process in any such action or contempt proceeding may be served in any judicial district wherein the entity or party refusing, or failing to comply, or threatening to refuse or not to comply, resides, transacts business, or may be found, and subpenas for witnesses who are required to attend such proceeding may run into any other district.
Nothing in this section shall confer upon such court jurisdiction to affect by injunction or otherwise the issuance or effect of any subpena or order of the Senate or any committee or subcommittee of the Senate or to review, modify, suspend, terminate, or set aside any such subpena or order.
An action, contempt proceeding, or sanction brought or imposed pursuant to this section shall not abate upon adjournment sine die by the Senate at the end of a Congress if the Senate or the committee or subcommittee of the Senate which issued the subpena or order certifies to the court that it maintains its interest in securing the documents, answers, or testimony during such adjournment.

[(c) Repealed.

§1367. Supplemental jurisdiction

(a) Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) or as expressly provided otherwise by Federal statute, in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution.
Such supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties.

(b) In any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded solely on section 1332 of this title, the district courts shall not have supplemental jurisdiction under subsection (a) over claims by plaintiffs against persons made parties under Rule 14, 19, 20, or 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or over claims by persons proposed to be joined as plaintiffs under Rule 19 of such rules, or seeking to intervene as plaintiffs under Rule 24 of such rules, when exercising supplemental jurisdiction over such claims would be inconsistent with the jurisdictional requirements of section 1332.

(c) The district courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim under subsection (a) if—

(1) the claim raises a novel or complex issue of State law,

(2) the claim substantially predominates over the claim or claims over which the district court has original jurisdiction,

(3) the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction, or

(4) in exceptional circumstances, there are other compelling reasons for declining jurisdiction.

(d) The period of limitations for any claim asserted under subsection (a), and for any other claim in the same action that is voluntarily dismissed at the same time as or after the dismissal of the claim under subsection (a), shall be tolled while the claim is pending and for a period of 30 days after it is dismissed unless State law provides for a longer tolling period.

(e) As used in this section, the term “State” includes the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and any territory or possession of the United States.

Chapter Referred to in Other Sections

This chapter is referred to in title 42 section 3612.

§1391. Venue generally

(a) A civil action wherein jurisdiction is founded only on diversity of citizenship may, except as otherwise provided by law, be brought only in (1) a judicial district where any defendant resides, if all defendants reside in the same State, (2) a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated, or (3) a judicial district in which any defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction at the time the action is commenced, if there is no district in which the action may otherwise be brought.

(b) A civil action wherein jurisdiction is not founded solely on diversity of citizenship may, except as otherwise provided by law, be brought only in (1) a judicial district where any defendant resides, if all defendants reside in the same State, (2) a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated, or (3) a judicial district in which any defendant may be found, if there is no district in which the action may otherwise be brought.

(c) For purposes of venue under this chapter, a defendant that is a corporation shall be deemed to reside in any judicial district in which it is subject to personal jurisdiction at the time the action is commenced.
In a State which has more than one judicial district and in which a defendant that is a corporation is subject to personal jurisdiction at the time an action is commenced, such corporation shall be deemed to reside in any district in that State within which its contacts would be sufficient to subject it to personal jurisdiction if that district were a separate State, and, if there is no such district, the corporation shall be deemed to reside in the district within which it has the most significant contacts.

(d) An alien may be sued in any district.

(e) A civil action in which a defendant is an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof acting in his official capacity or under color of legal authority, or an agency of the United States, or the United States, may, except as otherwise provided by law, be brought in any judicial district in which (1) a defendant in the action resides, (2) a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated, or (3) the plaintiff resides if no real property is involved in the action.
Additional persons may be joined as parties to any such action in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and with such other venue requirements as would be applicable if the United States or one of its officers, employees, or agencies were not a party.

The summons and complaint in such an action shall be served as provided by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure except that the delivery of the summons and complaint to the officer or agency as required by the rules may be made by certified mail beyond the territorial limits of the district in which the action is brought.

(f) A civil action against a foreign state as defined in section 1603(a) of this title may be brought—

(1) in any judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated;

(2) in any judicial district in which the vessel or cargo of a foreign state is situated, if the claim is asserted under section 1605(b) of this title;

(3) in any judicial district in which the agency or instrumentality is licensed to do business or is doing business, if the action is brought against an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state as defined in section 1603(b) of this title; or

(4) in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia if the action is brought against a foreign state or political subdivision thereof.

(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 935; Oct. 5, 1962, Pub. L. 87–748, §2, 76 Stat. 744; Dec. 23, 1963, Pub. L. 88–234, 77 Stat. 473; Nov. 2, 1966, Pub.

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§111, 112 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§50, 51, 36 Stat. 1101; Sept. 19, 1922, ch. 345, 42 Stat. 849; Mar. 4, 1925, ch. 526, §1, 43 Stat. 1264; Apr. 16, 1936, ch. 230, 49 Stat. 1213).

Section consolidates section 111 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with part of section 112 of such title.

The portion of section 112 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to venue generally constitutes this section and the parts relating to arrest of the defendant, venue and process in stockholders’ actions constitute sections 1401, 1693, and 1695 of this title.

Provision in section 111 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that a district court may proceed as to parties before it although one or more defendants do not reside in the district, and that its judgment shall be without prejudice to such absent defendants, was omitted as covered by rule 19(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Word “action” was substituted for “suit” in view of Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Word “reside” was substituted for “whereof he is an inhabitant” for clarity inasmuch as “inhabitant” and “resident” are synonymous. (See Ex parte Shaw, 1892, 12 S.Ct. 935, 145 U.S. 444, 36 L.Ed. 768; Standard Stoker Co., Inc. v. Lower, D.C., 1931, 46 F.2d 678; Edgewater Realty Co. v. Tennessee Coal, Iron & Railroad Co., D.C., 1943, 49 F.Supp. 807.)

Reference to “all plaintiffs” and “all defendants” were substituted for references to “the plaintiff” and “the defendant,” in view of many decisions holding that the singular terms were used in a collective sense. (See Smith v. Lyon, 1890, 10 S.Ct. 303, 133 U.S. 315, 33 L.Ed. 635; Hooe v. Jamieson, 1897, 17 S.Ct. 596, 166 U.S. 395, 41 L.Ed. 1049; and Fetzer v. Livermore, D.C., 1926, 15 F.2d 462.)

In subsection (c), references to defendants “found” within a district or voluntarily appearing were omitted.
The use of the word “found” made section 111 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ambiguous.
The argument that an action could be brought in the district where one defendant resided and a nonresident defendant was “found,” was rejected in Camp v. Gress, 1919, 39 S.Ct. 478, 250 U.S. 308, 63 L.Ed. 997. However, this ambiguity will be obviated in the future by the omission of such reference.

Subsection (d) of this section is added to give statutory recognition to the weight of authority concerning a rule of venue as to which there has been a sharp conflict of decisions. (See Sandusky Foundry & Machine Co. v. DeLavand, 1918, D.C.Ohio, 251 F. 631, 632, and cases cited.
See also Keating v. Pennsylvania Co., 1917, D.C.Ohio, 245 F. 155 and cases cited.)

Changes were made in phraseology.

§1392. Defendants or property in different districts in same State

(a) Any civil action, not of a local nature, against defendants residing in different districts in the same State, may be brought in any of such districts.

(b) Any civil action, of a local nature, involving property located in different districts in the same State, may be brought in any of such districts.

(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 935.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§113, 116 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§52, 55, 36 Stat. 1101, 1102).

Section consolidates section 113 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with section 116 of such title.

Last sentence of section 113 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to execution on judgments or decrees, was omitted as covered by section 2001 et seq. of this title.

Words “civil action” were substituted for “suit” in view of Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Words of said section 113, “against a single defendant, inhabitant of such State, must be brought in the district where he resides” were omitted as covered by section 1391 of this title.

Words of section 116 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., “land or other subject matter of a fixed character” were deleted and the word “property” substituted for flexibility and uniformity. (See sections 754, 1692, of this title and reviser's notes thereunder.)

Words of said section 116, “and the court in which it is brought shall have jurisdiction to hear and decide it, and to cause mesne or final process to be issued and executed, as fully as if the said subject matter were wholly within the district for which such court is constituted” were omitted as surplusage and fully covered by Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
Said rule also covers the following omitted language: “A duplicate writ may be issued against the defendants, directed to the marshal of any other district in which any defendant resides.”

Changes were made in phraseology.

(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 936.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§104, 106, 107, and 108, and section 3745(c) of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Internal Revenue Code (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§43, 45, 46, 47, 36 Stat. 1100; Feb. 10, 1939, ch. 2, §3745(c), 53 Stat. 460).

This section consolidates section 3745(c) of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with sections 104, 106, 107, and 108 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to venue in civil proceedings to recover and enforce civil fines, penalties, and forfeitures, pecuniary or otherwise.

Subsection (b) substituted words “may be prosecuted in any district where such property is found” for “shall be prosecuted in the district where the seizure is made,” to include not only property seized, but also all other property subject to forfeiture.

Words “civil” and “fine” were inserted to make this section applicable to the many provisions of the United States Code for fines essentially civil. (See reviser's note under section 1355 of this title.)

Provisions of section 3745(c) of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that such suit may be brought “before any other court of competent jurisdiction” were omitted as misleading surplusage, since United States district courts, under section 1355 of this title, have exclusive jurisdiction.

Subsection (d) was added for completeness and clarity.

Changes were made in phraseology.

(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 936; Aug. 30, 1964, Pub. L. 88–513, §2, 78 Stat. 695; Jan. 2, 1975, Pub. L. 93–584, §2, 88 Stat. 1917; Apr. 2, 1982, Pub. L. 97–164, title I, §130, 96 Stat. 39; Oct. 29, 1992, Pub. L. 102–572, title IX, §902(b)(1), 106 Stat. 4516.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §43 (Oct. 22, 1913, ch. 32, 38 Stat. 219).

This section is completely rewritten to give effect to changes recommended by the Judicial Conference of the United States.

Section 43 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., is as follows:

“§43. Venue of suits relating to orders of Interstate Commerce Commission.

“The venue of any suit brought to enforce, suspend, or set aside, in whole or in part, any order of the Interstate Commerce Commission shall be in the judicial district wherein is the residence of the party or any of the parties upon whose petition the order was made, except that where the order does not relate to transportation or is not made upon the petition of any party the venue shall be in the district where the matter complained of in the petition before the commission arises, and except that where the order does not relate either to transportation or to a matter so complained of before the commission the matter covered by the order shall be deemed to arise in the district where one of the petitioners in court has either its principal office or its principal operating office.
In case such transportation relates to a through shipment the term ‘destination’ shall be construed as meaning final destination of such shipment.” The amendment of section 207 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., proposed by the Judicial Conference is:

“Except as otherwise provided in the Act entitled ‘An Act to Regulate Commerce’, approved February 4, 1887, as amended, the venue of any suit brought to enforce, suspend, or set aside, in whole or in part, any order of the Interstate Commerce Commission shall be in the judicial district wherein is the residence of the party or any of the parties bringing the suit or wherein such party or any of such parties has its principal office.”

The revised section substitutes the words “Except as otherwise provided by law” for the words of the conference bill, “in the act entitled ‘An Act to Regulate Commerce, approved February 4, 1887, as amended’ ”. (See section 16 of title 49, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which provides for jurisdiction and venue of actions to enforce Interstate Commerce Commission orders for the payment of money.)

Abolition of Interstate Commerce Commission and Transfer of Functions

Interstate Commerce Commission abolished and functions of Commission transferred, except as otherwise provided in Pub. L. 104–88, to Surface Transportation Board effective Jan. 1, 1996, by section 702 of Title 49, Transportation, and section 101 of Pub. L. 104–88, set out as a note under section 701 of Title 49.

Provisions of section 41(25) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to jurisdiction are the basis of section 1347 of this title.

(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 936; Nov. 19, 1988, Pub. L. 100–702, title X, §1020(a)(5), 102 Stat. 4671.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §109, and section 35 of title 17, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Copyrights (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 320, §35, 35 Stat. 1084; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §48, 36 Stat. 1100).

Section consolidates section 35 of title 17, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with part of section 109 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with necessary changes in phraseology.

Subsection (b) is based on section 109 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with the following changes:

Words “civil action” were substituted for “suit,” and words “in law or in equity,” after “shall have jurisdiction” were deleted, in view of Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Words in subsection (b) “where the defendant resides” were substituted for “of which the defendant is an inhabitant.” A corresponding change was made in subsection (a). Words “inhabitant” and “resident,” as respects venue, are synonymous. (See reviser's note under section 1391 of this title.)

Words “whether a person, partnership, or corporation” before “has committed” were omitted as surplusage.

Section constitutes the first clause of the second sentence of section 257, of title 40, U.S.C., 1940 ed.
The revised section is expressive of the purpose of such section 257 with necessary changes in phraseology.

The jurisdiction provision of section 257 of title 40, U.S.C., 1940 ed., is incorporated in section 1358 of this title.

The remainder of section 257 of title 40, U.S.C., 1940 ed., is retained in said title 40.

Provision with respect to property in different districts was added to conform with section 1392 of this title.

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§119, 163 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §58, 36 Stat. 1103; Sept. 8, 1916, ch. 475, §5, 39 Stat. 851).

Section consolidates sections 119 and 163 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with necessary changes in phraseology and substance.

Section 119 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., related only to transfer of cases from one division to another on stipulation of the parties.

Subsection (a) was drafted in accordance with the doctrine of forum non conveniens, permitting transfer to a more convenient forum, even though the venue is proper.
As an example of the need of such a provision, see Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Kepner, 1941, 62 S.Ct. 6, 314 U.S. 44, 86 L.Ed. 28, which was prosecuted under the Federal Employer's Liability Act in New York, although the accident occurred and the employee resided in Ohio.
The new subsection requires the court to determine that the transfer is necessary for convenience of the parties and witnesses, and further, that it is in the interest of justice to do so.

Sections 143, 172, 177, and 181 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to the district courts of Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, and Ohio, contained special provisions similar to subsection (b), applicable to those States.
To establish uniformity, the general language of such subsection has been drafted and the special provisions of those sections omitted.

Subsection (b) is based upon section 163 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which applied only to the district of Maine.
This revised subsection extends to all judicial districts and permits transfer of cases between divisions.
Criminal cases may be transferred pursuant to Rules 19–21 of the new Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and the criminal provisions of said section 163 are therefore omitted.

Termination of United States District Court for the District of the Canal Zone

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §121 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §59, 36 Stat. 1103).

Enforcement of liens in like circumstances is provided by section 1656 of this title.

Remainder of section 121 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., is incorporated in section 3240 of revised title 18, Crimes and Criminal Procedure (H.R. 1600, 80th Cong.).

Changes were made in phraseology.

§1406. Cure or waiver of defects

(a) The district court of a district in which is filed a case laying venue in the wrong division or district shall dismiss, or if it be in the interest of justice, transfer such case to any district or division in which it could have been brought.

(b) Nothing in this chapter shall impair the jurisdiction of a district court of any matter involving a party who does not interpose timely and sufficient objection to the venue.

(c) As used in this section, “district court” includes the United States District Court for the District of the Canal Zone; and “district” includes the territorial jurisdiction of that court.

(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 937; May 24, 1949, ch. 139, §81, 63 Stat. 101; Sept. 13, 1960, Pub. L. 86–770, §1, 74 Stat. 912; Oct. 18, 1962, Pub. L. 87–845, §10, 76A Stat. 699; Apr. 2, 1982, Pub. L. 97–164, title I, §132, 96 Stat. 39.)

Historical and Revision Notes

1948 Act

Subsection (a) provides statutory sanction for transfer instead of dismissal, where venue is improperly laid.

Subsection (b) is declaratory of existing law. (See Panama R.R. Co. v. Johnson, 1924, 44 S.Ct. 391, 264 U.S. 375, 68 L.Ed. 748.) It makes clear the intent of Congress that venue provisions are not jurisdictional but may be waived.

1949 Act

This section removes an ambiguity in section 1406(a) of title 28, U.S.C., by substituting “may” for “shall”, thus making it clear that the court may decline to transfer a case brought in the wrong district under circumstances where it would not be in the interest of justice to make such transfer.

Termination of United States District Court for the District of the Canal Zone

For termination of the United States District Court for the District of the Canal Zone at end of the “transition period”, being the 30-month period beginning Oct. 1, 1979, and ending midnight Mar. 31, 1982, see Paragraph 5 of Article XI of the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977 and sections 3831 and 3841 to 3843 of Title 22, Foreign Relations and Intercourse.

§1407. Multidistrict litigation

(a) When civil actions involving one or more common questions of fact are pending in different districts, such actions may be transferred to any district for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings.
Such transfers shall be made by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation authorized by this section upon its determination that transfers for such proceedings will be for the convenience of parties and witnesses and will promote the just and efficient conduct of such actions.
Each action so transferred shall be remanded by the panel at or before the conclusion of such pretrial proceedings to the district from which it was transferred unless it shall have been previously terminated: Provided, however, That the panel may separate any claim, cross-claim, counter-claim, or third-party claim and remand any of such claims before the remainder of the action is remanded.

(b) Such coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings shall be conducted by a judge or judges to whom such actions are assigned by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation.
For this purpose, upon request of the panel, a circuit judge or a district judge may be designated and assigned temporarily for service in the transferee district by the Chief Justice of the United States or the chief judge of the circuit, as may be required, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 13 of this title.
With the consent of the transferee district court, such actions may be assigned by the panel to a judge or judges of such district.
The judge or judges to whom such actions are assigned, the members of the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation, and other circuit and district judges designated when needed by the panel may exercise the powers of a district judge in any district for the purpose of conducting pretrial depositions in such coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings.

(c) Proceedings for the transfer of an action under this section may be initiated by—

(i) the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation upon its own initiative, or

(ii) motion filed with the panel by a party in any action in which transfer for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings under this section may be appropriate.
A copy of such motion shall be filed in the district court in which the moving party's action is pending.

The panel shall give notice to the parties in all actions in which transfers for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings are contemplated, and such notice shall specify the time and place of any hearing to determine whether such transfer shall be made.
Orders of the panel to set a hearing and other orders of the panel issued prior to the order either directing or denying transfer shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the district court in which a transfer hearing is to be or has been held.
The panel's order of transfer shall be based upon a record of such hearing at which material evidence may be offered by any party to an action pending in any district that would be affected by the proceedings under this section, and shall be supported by findings of fact and conclusions of law based upon such record.
Orders of transfer and such other orders as the panel may make thereafter shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the district court of the transferee district and shall be effective when thus filed.
The clerk of the transferee district court shall forthwith transmit a certified copy of the panel's order to transfer to the clerk of the district court from which the action is being transferred.
An order denying transfer shall be filed in each district wherein there is a case pending in which the motion for transfer has been made.

Petitions for an extraordinary writ to review an order to transfer or orders subsequent to transfer shall be filed only in the court of appeals having jurisdiction over the transferee district.
There shall be no appeal or review of an order of the panel denying a motion to transfer for consolidated or coordinated proceedings.

(f) The panel may prescribe rules for the conduct of its business not inconsistent with Acts of Congress and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

(g) Nothing in this section shall apply to any action in which the United States is a complainant arising under the antitrust laws. “Antitrust laws” as used herein include those acts referred to in the Act of October 15, 1914, as amended (38 Stat. 730; 15 U.S.C. 12), and also include the Act of June 19, 1936 (49 Stat. 1526; 15 U.S.C. 13, 13a, and 13b) and the Act of September 26, 1914, as added March 21, 1938 (52 Stat. 116, 117; 15 U.S.C. 56); but shall not include section 4A of the Act of October 15, 1914, as added July 7, 1955 (69 Stat. 282; 15 U.S.C. 15a).

Rule 12. Conditional Transfer Orders for “Tag-Along Actions”

(a) Upon learning of the pendency of a potential “tag-along action,” as defined in Rule 1 of these Rules, an order may be entered by the Clerk of the Panel transferring that action to the previously designated transferee district court on the basis of the prior hearing or hearings and for the reasons expressed in previous opinions and orders of the Panel in the litigation.
The Clerk of the Panel shall serve this order on each party to the litigation but, in order to afford all parties the opportunity to oppose transfer, shall not send the order to the clerk of the transferee district court for fifteen days from the entry thereof.

(b) Parties to an action subject to a conditional transfer order shall notify the Clerk of the Panel within the fifteen-day period if that action is no longer pending in its transferor district court.

(c) Any party opposing the transfer shall file a notice of opposition with the Clerk of the Panel within the fifteen-day period.
If a notice of opposition is received by the Clerk of the Panel within this fifteen-day period, the Clerk of the Panel shall not transmit said order to the clerk of the transferee district court until further order of the Panel.

(d) Within fifteen days of the filing of its notice of opposition, the party opposing transfer shall file a motion to vacate the conditional transfer order and brief in support thereof.
The Clerk of the Panel shall set the motion for hearing at the next appropriate session of the Panel.
Failure to file and serve a motion and brief shall be treated as withdrawal of the opposition and the Clerk of the Panel shall forthwith transmit the order to the clerk of the transferee district court.

(e) Conditional transfer orders do not become effective unless and until they are filed with the clerk of the transferee district court.

(f) Notices of opposition and motions to vacate orders of the Panel and responses thereto shall be governed by Rules 7, 8, 9 and 10 of these Rules.

(As amended June 14, 1988, eff.
July 6, 1988.)

Rule 13. Miscellaneous Provisions Concerning “Tag-Along Actions”

(a) Potential “tag-along actions” filed in the transferee district require no action on the part of the Panel and requests for assignment of such actions to the Section 1407 transferee judge should be made in accordance with local rules for the assignment of related actions.

(b) Upon learning of the pendency of a potential “tag-along action” and having reasonable anticipation of opposition to transfer of that action, the Panel may direct the Clerk of the Panel to file a show cause order, in accordance with Rule 11 of these Rules, instead of a conditional transfer order.

(c) Failure to serve one or more of the defendants in a potential “tag-along action” with the complaint and summons as required by Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure does not preclude transfer of such action under Section 1407. Such failure, however, may be submitted by such a defendant as a basis for opposing the proposed transfer.
The inability of the Clerk of the Panel to serve a conditional transfer order on all defendants or their counsel shall not render the transfer of the action void but can be submitted by such a defendant as a basis for moving to remand as to such defendant.

(d) A civil action apparently involving common questions of fact with actions under consideration by the Panel for transfer under Section 1407, which was filed or came to the attention of the Panel either after the initial hearing before it or too late to be included in the initial hearing, will be treated by the Panel as a potential “tag-along action.”

(e) Any party or counsel in actions previously transferred under Section 1407 or under consideration by the Panel for transfer under Section 1407 shall promptly notify the Clerk of the Panel of any potential “tag-along actions” in which that party is also named or in which that counsel appears.

(As amended June 14, 1988, eff.
July 6, 1988; May 3, 1993, eff.
July 1, 1993.)

Rule 14. Termination and Remand

In the absence of unusual circumstances—

(a) Actions terminated in the transferee district court by valid judgment, including but not limited to summary judgment, judgment of dismissal and judgment upon stipulation, shall not be remanded by the Panel and shall be dismissed by the transferee district court.
The clerk of the transferee district court shall send a copy of the order terminating the action to the Clerk of the Panel but shall retain the original files and records unless otherwise directed by the transferee judge or by the Panel.

(b) Each transferred action that has not been terminated in the transferee district court shall be remanded by the Panel to the transferor district for trial, unless ordered transferred by the transferee judge to the transferee or other district under 28 U.S.C. §1404(a) or 28 U.S.C. §1406. In the event that the transferee judge so transfers an action under 28 U.S.C. §1404(a) or 1406, no further action of the Panel shall be necessary to authorize further proceedings including trial.
Actions that were originally filed in the transferee district require no action by the Panel to be reassigned to another judge in the transferee district at the conclusion of the coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings affecting those actions.

(c) The Panel shall consider remand of each transferred action or any separable claim, cross-claim, counterclaim or third-party claim at or before the conclusion of coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings on

(i) motion of any party,

(ii) suggestion of the transferee district court, or

(iii) the Panel's own initiative, by entry of an order to show cause, a conditional remand order or other appropriate order.

(d) The Panel is reluctant to order remand absent a suggestion of remand from the transferee district court.
If remand is sought be motion of a party, the motion shall be accompanied by:

(i) an affidavit reciting

(A) whether the movant has requested a suggestion of remand from the transferee district court, how the court responded to any request, and, if no such request was made, why;

(B) whether all common discovery and other pretrial proceedings have been completed in the action sought to be remanded, and if not, what remains to be done; and

(C) whether all orders of the transferee district court have been satisfactorily complied with, and if not, what remains to be done; and

(ii) a copy of the transferee district court's final pretrial order, where such order has been entered.

Motions to remand and responses thereto shall be governed by Rules 7, 8, 9 and 10 of these Rules.

(e) When an order to show cause why an action or actions should not be remanded is entered pursuant to subsection (c), paragraph (iii) of this Rule, any party may file a response within twenty days of the filing of said order unless otherwise provided for in the order.
Within five days of filing of a party's response, any party may file a reply brief limited to new matters.
Failure of a party to respond to a show cause order regarding remand shall be treated as that party's acquiescence to the remand.
Responses and replies shall be filed and served in conformity with Rules 7, 8 and 9 of these Rules.

(f) Conditional Remand Orders

(i) When the Panel has been advised by the transferee district judge, or otherwise has reason to believe, that pretrial proceedings in the litigation assigned to the transferee district judge are concluded or that remand of an action or actions is otherwise appropriate, an order may be entered by the Clerk of the Panel remanding the action or actions to the transferor district court.
The Clerk of the Panel shall serve this order on each party to the litigation but, in order to afford all parties the opportunity to oppose remand, shall not send the order to the clerk of the transferee district court for fifteen days from the entry thereof.

(ii) Any party opposing the remand shall file a notice of opposition with the Clerk of the Panel within the fifteen-day period.
If a notice of opposition is received by the Clerk of the Panel within this fifteen-day period, the Clerk of the Panel shall not transmit said order to the clerk of the transferee district court until further order of the Panel.

(iii) Within fifteen days of the filing of its notice of opposition, the party opposing remand shall file a motion to vacate the conditional remand order and brief in support thereof.
The Clerk of the Panel shall set the motion for hearing at the next appropriate session of the Panel.
Failure to file and serve a motion and brief shall be treated as a withdrawal of the opposition and the Clerk of the Panel shall forthwith transmit the order to the clerk of the transferee district court.

(iv) Conditional remand orders do not become effective unless and until they are filed with the clerk of the transferee district court.

(v) Notices of opposition and motions to vacate such orders of the Panel and responses thereto shall be governed by Rules 7, 8, 9 and 10 of these Rules.

(g) Upon receipt of an order to remand from the Clerk of the Panel, the parties shall furnish forthwith to the transferee district clerk a stipulation or designation of the contents of the record or part thereof to be remanded and furnish the transferee district clerk all necessary copies of any pleading or other matter filed so as to enable the transferee district clerk to comply with the order of remand.

(As amended June 14, 1988, eff.
July 6, 1988; May 3, 1993, eff.
July 1, 1993.)

Rule 15. Applications for Extensions of Time

Any application for an extension of time to file a pleading or perform an act required by these Rules must be in writing, must request a specific number of additional days and may be acted upon by the Clerk of the Panel.
Such an application will be evaluated in relation to the impact on the Panel's calendar as well as on the basis of the reasons set forth in support of the application.
Any party aggrieved by the Clerk of the Panel's action on such application may submit its objections to the Panel for consideration.
Absent exceptional circumstances, no extensions of time shall be granted to file a notice of opposition to either a conditional transfer order or a conditional remand order.
All applications for extensions of time shall be filed and served in conformity with Rules 7, 8 and 9 of these Rules.

(As amended June 14, 1988, eff.
July 6, 1988; May 3, 1993, eff.

Rule 16. Hearings

(a) Hearings shall be held as ordered by the Panel.
The Panel shall convene whenever and wherever desirable or necessary in the judgment of the Chairman.
The Chairman shall determine which matters shall be set for hearing at each session and the Clerk of the Panel shall give notice to counsel for all parties involved in the litigation of the time, place and subject matter of such hearing.

(b) No transfer or remand determination regarding any action pending in district court shall be made by the Panel when any party timely opposes such transfer or remand unless a hearing has been held or unless the matter has been submitted on the briefs in accordance with Rule 17 of these Rules.
Unless otherwise ordered by the Panel, all other matters before the Panel, such as a motion for reconsideration, shall be considered and determined upon the basis of the papers filed.

(c) Except for leave of the Panel on a showing of good cause, only those parties to actions scheduled for hearing who have filed a motion or written response to a motion or order shall be permitted to appear before the Panel and present oral argument.

If a party is not present when a matter to be heard is called at the hearing, the matter shall not be rescheduled and that party's position shall be treated as submitted for decision by the Panel on the basis of the papers filed, unless otherwise ordered by the Panel.

(As amended June 14, 1988, eff.
July 6, 1988.)

Rule 18. Effect of the Pendency of an Action Before the Panel

The pendency of a motion, order to show cause, conditional transfer order or conditional remand order before the Panel concerning transfer or remand of an action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1407 does not affect or suspend orders and pretrial proceedings in the district court in which the action is pending and does not in any way limit the pretrial jurisdiction of that court.
A transfer or remand pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1407 shall be effective when the transfer or remand order is filed in the office of the clerk of the district court of the transferee district.

(As amended June 14, 1988, eff.

Rule 19. Transfer of Files

(b) If an appeal is pending, or a notice of appeal has been filed, or leave to appeal has been sought under 28 U.S.C. §1292(b) or a petition for an extraordinary writ is pending, in any action included in an order of transfer under 28 U.S.C. §1407, and the original file or parts thereof have been forwarded to the court of appeals, the clerk of the transferor district court shall notify the clerk of the court of appeals of the order of transfer and secure the original file long enough to prepare and transmit to the clerk of the transferee district court a certified copy of the docket sheet.

(c) If the transfer order provides for the separation and simultaneous remand of any claim, cross-claim, counterclaim, or third-party claim, the clerk of the transferor district court shall retain the original file and shall prepare and transmit to the clerk of the transferee district court a certified copy of the docket sheet and copies of all papers except those relating exclusively to separated and remanded claims.

(d) Upon receipt of an order to remand from the Clerk of the Panel, the transferee district court shall prepare and send to the clerk of the transferor district court the following:
