“(c) Cooperative Agreements and Memoranda of Understanding.—To achieve the purposes of this Act [title] and to ensure effective coordination of the Federal and non-Federal elements of the 225th Anniversary with National Park Service units and programs, the Secretary may enter into cooperative agreements and memoranda of understanding with, and provide technical assistance to, the following:

Each year we Americans set aside one day to honor the brave and dedicated men and women of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard.

They serve our nation with dignity, courage, and pride in duty stations throughout the world.
The peace we enjoy today reminds us of their important role.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, RONALD REAGAN, President of the United States of America and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States, continuing the precedent of my seven immediate predecessors in this Office, do hereby proclaim the third Saturday of each May as Armed Forces Day.

I direct the Secretary of Defense on behalf of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and the Marine Corps, and the Secretary of Transportation on behalf of the Coast Guard, to plan for appropriate observances each year, with the Secretary of Defense responsible for soliciting the participation and cooperation of civil authorities and private citizens.

I invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, to provide for the observance of Armed Forces Day within their jurisdiction each year in an appropriate manner designed to increase public understanding and appreciation of the Armed Forces of the United States.

I also invite national and local veterans, civic and other organizations to join in the observance of Armed Forces Day each year.

I call upon all Americans not only to display the flag of the United States at their homes on Armed Forces Day, but also to learn about our system of defense, and about the men and women who sustain it, by attending and participating in the local observances of the day.

Proclamation 4571 of May 15, 1978, is hereby superseded.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this 16th day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-two and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and sixth.

No. 5574. The Rose Proclaimed the National Floral Emblem of the United States of America

Proc.
No. 5574, Nov. 20, 1986, 51 F.R. 42197, provided:

Americans have always loved the flowers with which God decorates our land.
More often than any other flower, we hold the rose dear as the symbol of life and love and devotion, of beauty and eternity.
For the love of man and woman, for the love of mankind and God, for the love of country, Americans who would speak the language of the heart do so with a rose.

We see proofs of this everywhere.
The study of fossils reveals that the rose has existed in America for age upon age.
We have always cultivated roses in our gardens.
Our first President, George Washington, bred roses, and a variety he named after his mother is still grown today.
The White House itself boasts a beautiful Rose Garden.
We grow roses in all our fifty States.
We find roses throughout our art, music, and literature.
We decorate our celebrations and parades with roses.
Most of all, we present roses to those we love, and we lavish them on our altars, our civil shrines, and the final resting places of our honored dead.

The American people have long held a special place in their hearts for roses.
Let us continue to cherish them, to honor the love and devotion they represent, and to bestow them on all we love just as God has bestowed them on us.

The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 159 [Pub. L. 99–449, now this section], has designated the rose as the National Floral Emblem of the United States and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation declaring this fact.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, RONALD REAGAN, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the rose as the National Floral Emblem of the United States of America.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eleventh.

Ronald Reagan.

(3) burials and reburials by the Armed Forces shall be carried out in accordance with plans prepared by the Commission; and

(3) The Secretary of the Treasury shall invest any portion of the fund that, as determined by the Chairman, is not required to meet current expenses.
Each investment shall be made in an interest-bearing obligation of the United States or an obligation guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States that, as determined by the Chairman, has a maturity suitable for the fund.

(c) Use of Fund.—The fund shall be available to the Commission—

(1) for the expenses of establishing the World War II memorial, including the maintenance and preservation amount provided for in section 8906(b) of title 40;

Borrowed amounts shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities during the month preceding the month in which the obligations of the Commission are issued.
The interest payments on such obligations may be deferred with the approval of the Secretary, but any interest payment so deferred shall also bear interest.

(2) The borrowing of money by the Commission under paragraph (1) shall be subject to such maturities, terms, and conditions as may be agreed upon by the Commission and the Secretary, except that the maturities may not exceed 20 years and such borrowings may be redeemable at the option of the Commission before maturity.

The authority of the Commission to issue obligations under this subsection shall remain available without fiscal year limitation.
The Secretary of the Treasury shall purchase any obligations of the Commission to be issued under this subsection, and for such purpose the Secretary of the Treasury may use as a public debt transaction of the United States the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31. The purposes for which securities may be issued under such chapter are extended to include any purchase of the Commission's obligations under this subsection.

(4) Repayment of the interest and principal on any funds borrowed by the Commission under paragraph (1) shall be made from amounts in the fund.
The Commission may not use for such purpose any funds appropriated for any other activities of the Commission.

A volunteer who is not otherwise employed by the United States shall not be considered to be a Federal employee for any other purpose by reason of the provision of such voluntary service, except that any volunteer given responsibility for the handling of funds or the carrying out of a Federal function is subject to the conflict of interest laws contained in chapter 11 of title 18 and the administrative standards of conduct contained in part 2635 of title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

(3) The Commission may provide for reimbursement of incidental expenses that are incurred by a person providing voluntary services under this subsection.
The Commission shall determine those expenses that are eligible for reimbursement under this paragraph.

(4) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require any Federal employee to work without compensation or to allow the use of volunteer services to displace or replace any Federal employee.

The text of 36:1166, 1213(a), and 5206(a) is omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement of 36:1102 and 1103 as general provisions covering, except as otherwise provided, all federally chartered corporations referred to in part B of subtitle II of the revised title.

The functions of the Federal Works Administrator were transferred to the Administrator of General Services by section 103(a) of the Act of June 30, 1949 (ch. 288, 63 Stat. 380).
