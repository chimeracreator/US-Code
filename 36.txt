Preamble

Act Jan. 5, 1905, as amended by act May 8, 1947, ch. 50, §§1, 2, 61 Stat. 80, provided:

“Whereas on the twenty-second of August, eighteen hundred and sixty-four, at Geneva, Switzerland, plenipotentiaries respectively representing Italy, Baden, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Portugal, France, Prussia, Saxony, and Wurttemberg and the Federal Council of Switzerland agreed upon ten articles of a treaty or convention for the purpose of mitigating the evils inseparable from war; of ameliorating the condition of soldiers wounded on the field of battle, and particularly providing, among other things, in effect, that persons employed in hospitals and in according relief to the sick and wounded and supplies for this purpose shall be deemed neutral and entitled to protection; and that a distinctive and uniform flag shall be adopted for hospitals and ambulances and convoys of sick and wounded and an arm badge for individuals neutralized; and

“Whereas the said treaty has been revised and extended by a treaty or convention for the amelioration of the condition of the wounded and the sick of armies in the field, signed at Geneva, July 27, 1929, and adhered to by the United States of America, effective August 8, 1932; and

“Whereas the International Conference of Geneva of eighteen hundred and sixty-three recommended ‘that there exist in every country a committee whose mission consists in cooperating in times of war with the hospital service of the armies by all means in its power;’ and

“Whereas a permanent organization is an agency needed in every nation to carry out the purposes of said treaties, and especially to secure supplies and to execute the humane objects contemplated by said treaties, with the power to adopt and use the distinctive flag and arm badge specified by said treaties, on which shall be the sign of the Red Cross, for the purpose of cooperating with the ‘ComiteÿAE1 International de Secours aux Militaires BlesseÿAE1s’ (International Committee of Relief for the Wounded in War); and

“Whereas in accordance with the requirements and customs of said international body such an association adopting and using said insignia was formed in the city of Washington, District of Columbia, in July, eighteen hundred and eighty-one known as ‘The American National Association of the Red Cross,’ reincorporated April seventeenth, eighteen hundred and ninety-three, under the laws of the District of Columbia, and reincorporated by Act of Congress in June, nineteen hundred; and

“Whereas it is believed that the importance of the work demands a repeal of the present charter and a reincorporation of the society under Government supervision: Now, therefore,”.

Change of Name

Department of War designated Department of the Army and title of Secretary of War changed to Secretary of the Army by section 205(a) of act July 26, 1947, ch. 343, title II, 61 Stat. 501. Section 205(a) of act July 26, 1947, was repealed by section 53 of act Aug. 10, 1956, ch. 1041, 70A Stat. 641.

The expiration of the Surplus Property Act of 1944, referred to in the third paragraph, means the expiration of act Oct. 3, 1944, ch. 479, 58 Stat. 765, which was classified principally to sections 1611 to 1641 of Title 50, Appendix, War and National Defense.
The expiration of such act was to occur, pursuant to section 38 of such act, three years after cessation of hostilities of World War II. Cessation of hostilities was proclaimed on Dec. 31, 1946, by Proc.

However, effective July 1, 1949, section 38 of act Oct. 3, 1944, along with substantially all of such act was repealed (except for sections 1622, 1631, 1637, and 1641 of Title 50, Appendix) by act June 30, 1949, ch. 288, title VI, §602(a)(1), 63 Stat. 399, renumbered Sept. 5, 1950, ch. 849, §6(a), (b), 64 Stat. 583. Sections 1622 and 1641 were partially repealed by the 1949 act, and section 1622 is still set out in part in Title 50, Appendix.
Section 1622(g) was repealed and reenacted as part of sections 47151 to 47153 of Title 49, Transportation, by Pub. L. 103–272, §§1(d), 7(b), July 5, 1994, 108 Stat. 1278–1280, 1379. Section 1631 was repealed by act June 7, 1939, ch. 190, §6(e), as added by act July 23, 1946, ch. 590, 60 Stat. 599, and is covered by sections 98 et seq. of Title 50, War and National Defense.
Section 1637 was repealed by act June 25, 1948, ch. 645, §21, 62 Stat. 862, eff.
Sept. 1, 1948, and is covered by section 3287 of Title 18, Crimes and Criminal Procedure.
Provisions of section 1641 not repealed by the 1949 act were repealed by Pub. L. 87–256, §111(a)(1), Sept. 21, 1961, 75 Stat. 538, and are covered by chapter 33 (§2451 et seq.) of Title 22, Foreign Relations and Intercourse.
The provisions of the Surplus Property Act of 1944 originally repealed by the 1949 act are covered by chapter 10 (§471 et seq.) of Title 40, Public Buildings, Property, and Works.

The 1942 Act originally enacted sections 224d to 224i–1, and repealed section 223a, of former Title 31, Money and Finance.
Sections 224d, 224h, and 224i of former Title 31 were repealed by the 1956 Act, and reenacted as section 2734 of Title 10, Armed Forces.
Sections 224e, 224f, 224g, and 224i–1 of former Title 31 were repealed by the 1956 Act as being unnecessary and executed.

§138c. American Battle Monuments Commission Foreign Currency Fluctuations Account

(a) Establishment; purpose; transfer of funds

There is hereby established in the Treasury an account to be known as the “Foreign Currency Fluctuations, American Battle Monuments Commission, Account”. The account shall be used to provide funds, in addition to funds appropriated for salaries and expenses of the American Battle Monuments Commission, to pay the costs of such salaries and expenses that exceed the amount appropriated therefor as a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates of foreign countries occurring after a budget request for the Commission is submitted to Congress.
The account may not be used for any other purpose.
Funds in the account may be transferred to funds appropriated for salaries and expenses of the Commission.

(b) Merger and availability of transferred funds; increase in permissible obligations of funds

Funds transferred under subsection (a) of this section shall be merged with and available for the same time period as the appropriation to which they are applied.
A provision of law limiting the amount of funds the Commission may obligate in any fiscal year shall be increased to the extent necessary to reflect fluctuations in exchange rates from those used in preparing the budget submission.

(c) Recording of obligations and fluctuations in exchange rates

An obligation of the Commission payable in the currency of a foreign country may be recorded as an obligation based upon exchange rates used in preparing a budget submission.
A change reflecting fluctuations in exchange rates may be recorded as a disbursement is made.

(d) Return of transferred funds

Funds transferred from the Foreign Currency Fluctuations, American Battle Monuments Commission, Account may be transferred back to that account—

(1) if the funds are not needed to pay obligations incurred because of fluctuations in currency exchange rates of foreign countries in the appropriation to which the funds were originally transferred; or

(2) because of subsequent favorable fluctuations in the rates or because other funds are, or become, available to pay such obligations.

(e) Time of return

A transfer back to the account under subsection (d) of this section may not be made after the end of the second fiscal year after the fiscal year in which the appropriation to which the funds were originally transferred is available for obligation.

(f) Unobligated balances; merger and availability

Not later than the end of the second fiscal year following the fiscal year for which appropriations for salaries and expenses have been made available to the Commission, unobligated balances of such appropriation provided for a fiscal year may be transferred into the Foreign Currency Fluctuations, American Battle Monuments Commission, Account, to be merged with and available for the same period and purposes as that account.

(g) Annual report on transferred funds

The Commission shall submit to the appropriate committees of the Congress each year a report on funds transferred under this section.

No. 4411. The Bicentennial Year

Proc.
No. 4411, Dec. 31, 1975, 41 F.R. 1035, provided:

In the year 1776, the people of our land dedicated themselves in word and deed to the principles of liberty, equality, individual dignity, and representative government.
It was a hectic but heroic beginning of a process which led to the creation of a great Republic symbolizing then, as it does today, the hope of the future.

The year 1776 was a year of revolution, not merely in the rejection of colonial rule, but in the thoughtful, eloquent, and enduring expression of a government to foster and perpetuate the development of a free and independent people.

Now, two hundred years later, we have settled our continent and turned our vision to the limits of the universe.
We are the richest nation in the world—rich in our resources, rich in our creativity, rich in our strength, and rich in our people—from our Native Americans to those who have come from every country on earth to share in the hope, the work, and the spirit of our Republic.

The challenges faced by our forebears were not only to their physical capabilities but also to their faith in the future.
Their response to these challenges affirmed their deep belief that by their actions they could create a better world for themselves and those that would follow.
As we enter America's third century, let us emulate in word and deed, their resolve and vision.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, GERALD R. FORD, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-six as The Bicentennial Year.
Let 1976 be a year of reflection, a year of sharing, and foremost, a year of achievement.

I urge all Americans to reflect, from time to time during this Bicentennial Year, on the historic events of our past, on the heroic deeds of those whose legacy we now enjoy, and on the compelling visions of those who helped shape our constitutional government.

I call upon educators, clergy and labor, business and community leaders, as well as those in the communications media, to review our history and publicize the shaping events, people, and ideas of our historic beginnings.

I call upon every man, woman, and child to celebrate the diversity of tradition, culture and heritage that reflects our people and our patrimony.
Let each of us resolve to cherish and protect what we have achieved in the United States of America and to build upon it in the years ahead, not by words alone, but by actions which bespeak a continuing commitment to a heritage of individual initiative, creativity, and liberty.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundredth.

Gerald R. Ford.      

Proc.
No. 4934. Armed Forces Day

Proc.
No. 4934, Apr. 16, 1982, 47 F.R. 16767, provided:

Each year we Americans set aside one day to honor the brave and dedicated men and women of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard.

They serve our nation with dignity, courage, and pride in duty stations throughout the world.
The peace we enjoy today reminds us of their important role.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, RONALD REAGAN, President of the United States of America and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States, continuing the precedent of my seven immediate predecessors in this Office, do hereby proclaim the third Saturday of each May as Armed Forces Day.

I direct the Secretary of Defense on behalf of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and the Marine Corps, and the Secretary of Transportation on behalf of the Coast Guard, to plan for appropriate observances each year, with the Secretary of Defense responsible for soliciting the participation and cooperation of civil authorities and private citizens.

I invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, to provide for the observance of Armed Forces Day within their jurisdiction each year in an appropriate manner designed to increase public understanding and appreciation of the Armed Forces of the United States.

I also invite national and local veterans, civic and other organizations to join in the observance of Armed Forces Day each year.

I call upon all Americans not only to display the flag of the United States at their homes on Armed Forces Day, but also to learn about our system of defense, and about the men and women who sustain it, by attending and participating in the local observances of the day.

Proclamation 4571 of May 15, 1978, is hereby superseded.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this 16th day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-two and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and sixth.

Ronald Reagan.

Proc.
No. 4064. Display of Flags at the Washington Monument

Proc.
No. 4064, July 6, 1971, 36 F.R. 12967, provided:

The Washington Monument stands day and night as America's tribute to our first President.
The fifty American flags that encircle the base of the Monument represent our fifty States and, at the same time, symbolize our enduring Federal Union.

As this Nation's 200th year approaches, I believe that it would do all Americans well to remember the years of our first President and to recall the enduring ideals of our Nation.

As an expression of our rededication to the ideals of America and in accordance with the joint resolution of Congress of June 22, 1942 (56 Stat. 377), as amended by the joint resolution of December 22, 1942, (56 Stat. 1074) [this section], which permits the flag to be displayed at night “upon special occasions when it is desired to produce a patriotic effect,” it is appropriate that our national colors henceforth be displayed day and night at the Washington Monument.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, RICHARD NIXON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim that, effective July 4, 1971, the fifty flags of the United States of America displayed at the Washington Monument in the District of Columbia be flown at all times during the day and night, except when the weather is inclement.

The rules and customs pertaining to the display of the flag as set forth in the joint resolution of June 22, 1942, as amended [section 173 et seq. of this title], are hereby modified accordingly.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-sixth.

Proc.
No. 4131. Display of Flag at United States Customs Ports of Entry

Proc.
No. 4131, May 5, 1972, 37 F.R. 9311, provided:

The flag of the United States should be one of the first things seen at our Customs ports of entry, both by American citizens returning from abroad and by travelers from other countries.

As the symbol of our country and our freedoms, the national colors of the United States provide a welcome greeting of warm promise.

Many people, however, enter our country at night when the flag is not flown, because of the nearly universal custom of displaying it only from sunrise to sunset.

Authority exists to amend that custom.
A Congressional joint resolution of June 22, 1942 (56 Stat. 377), as amended (36 U.S.C. 173–178), permits the flag to be displayed at night “upon special occasions when it is desired to produce a patriotic effect.”

I believe it is appropriate that returning citizens and visitors from other countries be welcomed by our flag whether they arrive at their ports of entry by night or by day.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, RICHARD NIXON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim that the flag of the United States of America shall hereafter be displayed at all times during the day and night, except when the weather is inclement, at United States Customs ports of entry which are continually open.

The rules and customs pertaining to the display of the flag, as set forth in the joint resolution of June 22, 1942, as amended, are hereby modified accordingly.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-sixth.

Richard Nixon.

Proc.
No. 5574, Nov. 20, 1986, 51 F.R. 42197, provided:

Americans have always loved the flowers with which God decorates our land.
More often than any other flower, we hold the rose dear as the symbol of life and love and devotion, of beauty and eternity.
For the love of man and woman, for the love of mankind and God, for the love of country, Americans who would speak the language of the heart do so with a rose.

We see proofs of this everywhere.
The study of fossils reveals that the rose has existed in America for age upon age.
We have always cultivated roses in our gardens.
Our first President, George Washington, bred roses, and a variety he named after his mother is still grown today.
The White House itself boasts a beautiful Rose Garden.
We grow roses in all our fifty States.
We find roses throughout our art, music, and literature.
We decorate our celebrations and parades with roses.
Most of all, we present roses to those we love, and we lavish them on our altars, our civil shrines, and the final resting places of our honored dead.

The American people have long held a special place in their hearts for roses.
Let us continue to cherish them, to honor the love and devotion they represent, and to bestow them on all we love just as God has bestowed them on us.

The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 159 [Pub. L. 99–449, 36 U.S.C. 187], has designated the rose as the National Floral Emblem of the United States and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation declaring this fact.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, RONALD REAGAN, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the rose as the National Floral Emblem of the United States of America.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eleventh.

(B) it more adequately meets the criteria of section 391(b) of this title, is capable of more adequately meeting the criteria of section 392 of this title, and provides or is capable of providing a more effective national program of competition, than the national governing body in the sport for which it seeks recognition.
