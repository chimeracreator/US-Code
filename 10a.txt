A Senior Judge shall not receive pay for the performance of such other duties with the Court but may be paid per diem and travel allowance to reimburse expenses incurred by the Senior Judge while performing such duties.

(c) Whether in the performance of judicial duties or other duties, a Senior Judge shall be provided such administrative and secretarial assistance, office space, and access to the Courthouse, other public buildings, court files, and related information, as the Chief Judge considers appropriate for the performance of those duties by the Senior Judge.

(d) The title of Senior Judge may not be used in any way for personal gain or in connection with any business activity, advertisement, or solicitation of funds.
However, the title of a Senior Judge may be referred to in any professional biography or listing and may be used in connection with any judicial or other duties that the Chief Judge requests the Senior Judge to perform.

(e) No Senior Judge of the Court may engage in the practice of law in connection with any matter that involves an investigation or trial for any matter arising under the Uniform Code of Military Justice or appellate review of any court-martial proceeding by a Court of Criminal Appeals, the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, or the Supreme Court of the United States.

(3) A statement of facts of the case material to the errors assigned, including specific page references to each relevant portion of the record of trial;

(4) A direct and concise argument showing why there is good cause to grant the petition, demonstrating with particularity why the errors assigned are materially prejudicial to the substantial rights of the appellant.
Where applicable, the supplement to the petition shall also indicate whether the court below has:

(A) decided a question of law which has not been, but should be, settled by this Court;

(B) decided a question of law in a way in conflict with applicable decisions of (i) this Court, (ii) the Supreme Court of the United States, (iii) another Court of Criminal Appeals, or (iv) another panel of the same Court of Criminal Appeals;

(F) so far departed from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings, or so far sanctioned such a departure by a court-martial or other person acting under the authority of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, as to call for an exercise of this Court's power of supervision; or

(G) taken inadequate corrective action after remand by the Court subsequent to grant of an earlier petition in the same case and that appellant wishes to seek review from the Supreme Court of the United States; and

(5) A certificate of filing and service in accordance with Rule 39(c).

A reply may be filed by the appellant no later than 10 days after the filing of the appellee's answer.

(d) The Court may, in its discretion, examine the record in any case for the purpose of determining whether there appears to be plain error not assigned by the appellant.
The Court may then specify and grant review of any such errors as well as any assigned errors which merit review.

(e) Where no specific errors are assigned in the supplement to the petition, the Court will proceed to review the petition without awaiting an answer thereto.
See Rule 19(a)(5).

(f) An appellant or counsel for an appellant may move to withdraw his petition at any time.

For good cause shown, the Court may suspend any of these rules in a particular case, on application of a party or on its own motion, and may order proceedings in accordance with its direction.  

Rule 34  . Computation of Time  

(a) General.
In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by these Rules, order of the Court, or any applicable statute, the day of the act, event, or default after which the designated period of time begins to run is not to be included.
The last day of the period so computed is to be included unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day which is neither a Saturday, Sunday, nor a holiday.
When the period of time prescribed or allowed is less than 7 days, intervening Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, will be excluded in the computation.
When a period of time is computed under these rules from the date of the decision of a Court of Criminal Appeals, such time is to be computed from the date of such decision unless a petition for reconsideration is timely filed, in which event the period of time is to be computed from the date of final action on the petition for reconsideration.  

(b) Additional time when service by mail.
Whenever a party has the right or is required to do some act within a prescribed period after the issuance of an order or the filing of a notice, pleading, or other paper relative to a case when service thereof is made upon him by mail, 5 days will be added to the prescribed period if the party upon whom the service is made is within the limits of the contiguous 48 States and the District of Columbia, and 15 days will be added if the party is located outside these limits, including the States of Alaska and Hawaii.
This provision for additional time shall not apply, however, to the time limitations prescribed in Rule 19(a)(1) for the filing of a petition for grant of review.

The name, address, telephone number, and rank, if any, of the person signing, together with the capacity in which such counsel signs the paper will be included.
This signature will constitute a certificate that the statements made in the pleading or paper are true and correct to the best of the counsel's knowledge, information, or belief, and that the pleading or paper is filed in good faith and not for the purpose of unnecessary delay.
A counsel who signs a pleading “for” some other counsel whose name is typed under such signature must, in addition, affix their own signature in a separate signature block with their own name, address, telephone number, and rank, if any, typed thereunder.  

(b) Exception.
If the counsel signing a pleading or paper presented to the Clerk's office for filing is not a member of the Bar of this Court, the pleading or paper shall nonetheless be received as if such counsel were a member.
However, within 30 days of the filing of a pleading, such counsel shall, as a prerequisite to continuing in the case as counsel of record, apply for admission to the Bar of this Court or move to appear pro hac vice under Rule 13.  

(As amended Oct. 1, 1987.)   

Rule 39  . Service of Pleadings

(a) The Court may, in its discretion and on its own motion, enter an order to reconsider its decision in any case not later than 30 days after service of such decision on the accused's appellate defense counsel or on the accused, if the accused is not represented by appellate counsel, provided a petition for grant of review or certificate for review has not been filed with the United States Court of Military Appeals, or a record of trial for review under Article 67(b) has not been received by that Court.
Copies of such order will be served on appellate defense counsel and appellate government counsel.
No briefs or arguments shall be received unless the order so directs.  

(b) Provided a petition for grant of review or certificate for review has not been filed with the United States Court of Military Appeals, or a record of trial for review under Article 67(b) has not been received by the United States Court of Military Appeals, the Court may, in its discretion, reconsider its decision in any case upon motion filed either:  

(1) By appellate defense counsel within 20 days after receipt by counsel, or by the accused if the accused is not represented by counsel, of a decision or order, or  

(2) By appellate government counsel within 20 days after the decision or order is received by counsel.

  (c) A motion for reconsideration shall briefly and directly state the grounds for reconsideration, including a statement of facts showing jurisdiction in the Court.
A reply to the motion for reconsideration will be received by the Court only if filed within 5 days of receipt of a copy of the motion.
Oral arguments shall not be heard on a motion for reconsideration unless ordered by the Court.
The original of the motion filed with the Court shall indicate the date of receipt of a copy of the same by opposing counsel.  

(d) The time limitations prescribed by this rule shall not be extended under the authority of Rule 24 or Rule 25 beyond the expiration of the time for filing a petition for review by the United States Court of Military Appeals, except that the time for filing briefs by either party may be extended for good cause.

to the honorable, the judges of the united states army1 court of military review

On ______, the accused was tried by general court-martial.
The charges and specifications upon which he was arraigned, his pleas, and the court-martial's findings were as follows:

 	Chg	Art UCMJ	Specs	Summary of Offenses	Pleas	Findings
	I	86	1	AWOL (28 Jan ____ –28 Feb____)	G	G
			2	AWOL (3 Mar ____ –3 Apr____)	G	G
	II	121		Larceny of $100.00, property of U.S. Government	NG	G

He was sentenced to dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, confinement at hard labor for 2 years, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade.
The convening authority approved only so much of the sentence as provides for bad conduct discharge, forfeiture of $50.00 pay per month for 6 months, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade.

Statement of Facts

Those facts necessary to a disposition of the assigned errors are set forth in the argument, infra.2

Errors and Argument

I

SPECIFICATION 1 OF CHARGE I FAILS TO STATE AN OFFENSE UNDER THE UNIFORM CODE OF MILITARY JUSTICE

The allegation of absence in Specification 1 of Charge I fails to indicate that the absence was “without proper authority.” The United States Court of Military Appeals has held that such an omission is fatal to the legal sufficiency of the specification.
United States v. Schultz, 16 U.S.C.M.A. 488, 37 C.M.R. 108 (1967); United States v. Fout, 3 U.S.C.M.A. 565, 13 C.M.R. 121 (1953).

WHEREFORE, the findings as to Specification 1 of Charge I should be set aside and the sentence reassessed on the basis of the remaining charges and specifications.

II

THE MILITARY JUDGE FAILED TO TAILOR HIS INSTRUCTIONS ON SENTENCE TO THE MATTERS PRESENTED IN MITIGATION AND EXTENUATION

There was extensive evidence presented on behalf of accused to establish his proper exemplary conduct in civilian and military life. (R. 108–133). The military judge limited his instructions on sentence to the maximum authorized punishment and the voting procedure.

In United States v. Wheeler, 17 U.S.C.M.A. 274, 38 C.M.R. 72 (1967), the failure of the military judge to tailor the instructions on sentence to the evidence presented in mitigation and extenuation was held to require a rehearing on sentence.

WHEREFORE, the sentence should be set aside and a rehearing authorized thereon.

Sentence Appropriateness

Accused is an 18-year old first time offender (Post-trial Review, p. 3) and has sincerely urged his restoration to duty. (R. 100). His immediate superiors have expressed their willingness to have accused return to his organization. (R. 110).

WHEREFORE, only so much of the sentence as provides for forfeiture of $50.00 pay per month for 6 months, confinement at hard labor for 6 months, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade should be approved by this Honorable Court.
