Rule 3A. Senior Judges

(a) With the Senior Judge's consent, and at the request of the Chief Judge, a Senior Judge may perform judicial duties with the Court if an active Judge of the Court is disabled or has recused himself or if there is a vacancy in an active judgeship on the Court.
For the periods of time when performing judicial duties with the Court, a Senior Judge shall receive the same pay, per diem, and travel allowances as an active Judge; and the receipt of pay shall be in lieu of receipt of retired pay or annuity with respect to these same periods.
The periods of performance of judicial duties by a Senior Judge shall be certified by the Chief Judge and recorded by the Clerk of Court.
The Clerk of Court shall notify the appropriate official to make timely payments of pay and allowances with respect to periods of time when a Senior Judge is performing judicial duties with the Court and shall notify the Department of Defense Military Retirement Fund to make appropriate adjustments in the Senior Judge's retired pay or annuity.
See Article 142(e)(2), Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 USC §942(e)(2).

(b) In addition to the performance of judicial duties with the Court, a Senior Judge may, at the request of the Chief Judge and with the Senior Judge's consent, perform such other duties as the Chief Judge may request or the Court may direct.
Such other duties may include, but are not limited to, service as a special master or as an adviser on Court operations, administration, and rules; representation of the Court at conferences, seminars, committee meetings or other official or professional functions; coordination of or assistance with conferences being conducted by the Court; and assistance in the compilation of history or archives of the Court.
A Senior Judge shall not receive pay for the performance of such other duties with the Court but may be paid per diem and travel allowance to reimburse expenses incurred by the Senior Judge while performing such duties.

(c) Whether in the performance of judicial duties or other duties, a Senior Judge shall be provided such administrative and secretarial assistance, office space, and access to the Courthouse, other public buildings, court files, and related information, as the Chief Judge considers appropriate for the performance of those duties by the Senior Judge.

(d) The title of Senior Judge may not be used in any way for personal gain or in connection with any business activity, advertisement, or solicitation of funds.
However, the title of a Senior Judge may be referred to in any professional biography or listing and may be used in connection with any judicial or other duties that the Chief Judge requests the Senior Judge to perform.

(e) No Senior Judge of the Court may engage in the practice of law in connection with any matter that involves an investigation or trial for any matter arising under the Uniform Code of Military Justice or appellate review of any court-martial proceeding by a Court of Criminal Appeals, the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, or the Supreme Court of the United States.

The Clerk will, in addition, acknowledge by letter, to the person filing such complaint, the receipt thereof.
The accused attorney will answer the complaint by filing a formal pleading responsive to each allegation of misconduct within 30 days of receipt of the complaint, but extensions of time may be granted by order of the Court on the accused attorney's application.
A complaint will be docketed only if the Court makes a preliminary determination that it is not frivolous.

(d) On consideration of the complaint and answer, and if it believes a substantial basis exists for the complaint, the Court will refer the matter to its Investigations Committee for consideration under subsection (b). Otherwise, the Court will dismiss the complaint.
Any such investigation will be held privately, unless the accused attorney requests that it be opened to the public.

(e) On receiving the report of the Investigations Committee, the Court may dismiss the complaint or order the matter set down for hearing, giving due notice to the accused attorney.

Upon the filing of the member's answer to an order to show cause, or upon expiration of 30 days if no answer is filed, the Court will enter an appropriate order; but no order of disbarment or suspension will be entered except with the concurrence of a majority of the judges participating.

(2) When it has been shown to the Court that a member of the Bar of the Court has been convicted by court-martial or by other court of competent jurisdiction of conduct which evidences a failure to comply with the Model Rules of Professional Conduct and such conviction has become final, the Court may, in lieu of the complaint and investigative procedures set forth in subsections (b) through (e), initiate a disciplinary action under this rule by issuance of an order to such person to show cause why the person should not be disbarred.
Upon the filing of the member's answer to an order to show cause, or upon expiration of 30 days if no answer is filed, the Court will set the matter for hearing, giving the member due notice thereof, or enter such other order as may be deemed appropriate; but no order of disbarment or suspension will be entered except with the concurrence of a majority of the judges participating.

(g) Penalties for unprofessional conduct may extend to reprimand, suspension, or disbarment.

(h) Except for an order of reprimand, suspension or disbarment, no papers, pleadings or other information relative to a complaint in a disciplinary proceeding will be published or released to the public without prior approval of the Court.

See Rules 13(a) and 38.

(b) Leave to withdraw by any counsel who has entered an appearance under subsection (a) must be requested by motion in accordance with Rule 30. A motion by an appellate defense counsel must indicate the reasons for the withdrawal and the provisions which have been made for continued representation of the accused.
A copy of a motion filed by an appellate defense counsel shall be delivered or mailed to the accused by the moving counsel.

Rule 17. Assignment of Counsel

Upon receipt of a notice of the docketing of a case issued under Rule 10(c), the appropriate Judge Advocate General shall designate appellate military counsel to represent the parties, unless such counsel have previously been designated.
In a case involving a petition for extraordinary relief wherein an accused has been denominated as the real party in interest by a filing party or has been so designated by the Court, the Judge Advocate General shall also designate appellate military counsel to represent such accused.

For good cause shown, the Court may suspend any of these rules in a particular case, on application of a party or on its own motion, and may order proceedings in accordance with its direction.

Rule 34. Computation of Time

(a) General.
In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by these Rules, order of the Court, or any applicable statute, the day of the act, event, or default after which the designated period of time begins to run is not to be included.
The last day of the period so computed is to be included unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day which is neither a Saturday, Sunday, nor a holiday.
When the period of time prescribed or allowed is less than 7 days, intervening Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, will be excluded in the computation.
When a period of time is computed under these rules from the date of the decision of a Court of Criminal Appeals, such time is to be computed from the date of such decision unless a petition for reconsideration is timely filed, in which event the period of time is to be computed from the date of final action on the petition for reconsideration.

(b) Additional time when service by mail.
Whenever a party has the right or is required to do some act within a prescribed period after the issuance of an order or the filing of a notice, pleading, or other paper relative to a case when service thereof is made upon him by mail, 5 days will be added to the prescribed period if the party upon whom the service is made is within the limits of the contiguous 48 States and the District of Columbia, and 15 days will be added if the party is located outside these limits, including the States of Alaska and Hawaii.
This provision for additional time shall not apply, however, to the time limitations prescribed in Rule 19(a)(1) for the filing of a petition for grant of review.

The name, address, telephone number, and rank, if any, of the person signing, together with the capacity in which such counsel signs the paper will be included.
This signature will constitute a certificate that the statements made in the pleading or paper are true and correct to the best of the counsel's knowledge, information, or belief, and that the pleading or paper is filed in good faith and not for the purpose of unnecessary delay.
A counsel who signs a pleading “for” some other counsel whose name is typed under such signature must, in addition, affix their own signature in a separate signature block with their own name, address, telephone number, and rank, if any, typed thereunder.

(As amended Oct. 1, 1987.)
