Transfer of Functions Relating to Shipping and Navigation

Bureau of Navigation created by act July 5, 1884. Act June 30, 1932, consolidated Bureau of Navigation with Steamboat Inspection Service to form a new bureau to be known as Bureau of Navigation and Steamboat Inspection, which name was changed to Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation by act May 27, 1936. Director of the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation was designation given to chief of bureau by Secretary of Commerce under act June 30, 1932, §502(b). Bureau and office of its Director abolished by Reorg.

Dept.
Reg. 51491, July 16, 1946, 11 F.R. 7766, the Commandant of the Coast Guard and The Commissioner of Customs each provided that all orders, rules, regulations, permits or other privileges made, issued or granted in respect of all functions transferred to him by Reorg.
Plan No. 3 of 1946, §§101–104, and in effect at the time of such transfer should continue in effect to the same extent as if such transfer had not occurred.

On the basis of 33 C.F.R. ch. I, and 46 C.F.R. ch. I, the Commandant of the Coast Guard appears to have assigned the functions transferred to him as follows:

 	Functions formerly performed by:	Now assigned to:
	Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation and its Director	Commandant of the Coast Guard
	Board of Supervising Inspectors	Commandant of the Coast Guard
	Supervising Inspector	Coast Guard District Commander
	Board of Local Inspectors	Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection
	Inspectors and Assistant Inspectors	Marine Inspectors (or “inspectors”)

For investigation of Marine casualties and suspension and revocation of licenses and certificates, formerly performed by the Marine Casualty Investigation Board and Marine Boards, see note set out under section 239 of this title.

Memoranda of the Chief Counsel of the Coast Guard, July 7, 1947, Chief Counsel of the Bureau of Customs, July 14, 1947, and Chief Counsel of the Treasury, July 21, 1947, concurred in the view that the duties of collectors of customs were not affected by Reorg.
Plan No. 3 of 1946, with the exception of those duties specified in section 101(b) of the Plan.

Certain Functions Formerly Performed by Bureau of Customs

The following is a statement relating to the transfer of certain functions from the Commissioner of Customs to the Commandant of the Coast Guard, appearing in 32 F.R. 7408, 7409, May 18, 1967:

On April 28, 1967, a memorandum of agreement was signed by the Commandant of the Coast Guard and the Commissioner of Customs which provided that—

Treasury Department Order No. 167–81 transferred from the Commissioner of Customs to the Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard, the functions pertaining to the admeasurement of vessels, the documentation of vessels, the publication of merchant vessel registers, the registration of stack insignia, and shoreside port security.
Because of the transfer of the Coast Guard from the Treasury Department to the Department of Transportation and because of continuing efforts to reorganize and modernize the shipping laws of the United States now assembled in title 46, U.S. Code, with a view toward eventual codification, it is recognized that the laws and provisions of law that relate to the transferred functions should be identified.

§104. Reciprocal exemption of foreign yachts from charges and tonnage taxes; licenses

Whenever it shall be made to appear to the satisfaction of the President of the United States that yachts used and employed exclusively as pleasure vessels and belonging to any resident of the United States are allowed to arrive at and depart from any foreign port and to cruise in the waters of such port without entering or clearing at the customhouse thereof and without the payment of any charges for entering or clearing, dues, duty per ton, tonnage taxes or charges for cruising licenses, the Commissioner of Customs may authorize and direct the customs authorities at the various ports of entry of the United States to allow yachts from such foreign port used and employed exclusively as pleasure vessels to arrive at and depart from any port of the United States and to cruise in waters of the United States without the payment of any charges for entering or clearing, dues, duty per ton, or tonnage taxes, but the Commissioner of Customs may, in his discretion, direct that such foreign yachts shall be required to obtain licenses to cruise, in a form prescribed by him, before they shall be allowed under the provisions of this section to cruise in waters of the United States.
Such licenses shall be issued without cost to such yachts and shall prescribe such limitations as to length of time, direction, and place of cruising and action, and such other particulars as the Commissioner of Customs may deem proper.

§121. Amount of tonnage duties

Upon vessels which shall be entered in the United States from any foreign port or place there shall be paid duties as follows: On vessels built within the United States but belonging wholly or in part to subjects of foreign powers, at the rate of thirty cents per ton; on other vessels not of the United States, at the rate of fifty cents per ton, and any vessel any officer of which shall not be a citizen of the United States shall pay a tax of fifty cents per ton.

A tonnage duty of 9 cents per ton, not to exceed in the aggregate 45 cents per ton in any one year, for fiscal years 1991 through 2002, and 2 cents per ton, not to exceed in the aggregate 10 cents per ton in any one year, for each fiscal year thereafter is imposed at each entry on all vessels which shall be entered in any port of the United States from any foreign port or place in North America, Central America, the West India Islands, the Bahama Islands, the Bermuda Islands, or the coast of South America bordering on the Caribbean Sea, or Newfoundland, and on all vessels (except vessels of the United States, recreational vessels, and barges, as those terms are defined in section 2101 of title 46) that depart a United States port or place and return to the same port or place without being entered in the United States from another port or place; and a duty of 27 cents per ton, not to exceed $1.35 per ton per annum, for fiscal years 1991 through 2002, and 6 cents per ton, not to exceed 30 cents per ton per annum, for each fiscal year thereafter is imposed at each entry on all vessels which shall be entered in any port of the United States from any other foreign port.
However, neither duty shall be imposed on vessels in distress or not engaged in trade.

Upon every vessel not of the United States, which shall be entered in one district from another district, having on board goods, wares, or merchandise taken in one district to be delivered in another district, duties shall be paid at the rate of 50 cents per ton: Provided, That no such duty shall be required where a vessel owned by citizens of the United States, but not a vessel of the United States, after entering an American port, shall, before leaving the same, be registered as a vessel of the United States.
On all foreign vessels which shall be entered in the United States from any foreign port or place, to and with which vessels of the United States are not ordinarily permitted to enter and trade, there shall be paid a duty at the rate of $2 per ton; and none of the duties on tonnage above mentioned shall be levied on the vessels of any foreign nation if the President of the United States shall be satisfied that the discriminating or countervailing duties of such foreign nations, so far as they operate to the disadvantage of the United States, have been abolished.
Any rights or privileges acquired by any foreign nation under the laws and treaties of the United States relative to the duty of tonnage on vessels shall not be impaired; and any vessel any officer of which shall not be a citizen of the United States shall pay a tax of 50 cents per ton.

(R.S. §4219; Feb. 27, 1877, ch. 69, §1, 19 Stat. 250; June 26, 1884, ch. 121, §14, 23 Stat. 57; Apr. 4, 1888, ch. 61, §1, 25 Stat. 80; Aug. 5, 1909, ch. 6, §36, 36 Stat. 111; Mar. 4, 1915, ch. 171, §1, 38 Stat. 1193; Pub.

Codification

R.S. §4219 derived from acts July 20, 1790, ch. 30, §1, 1 Stat. 135; Apr. 27, 1816, ch. 107, §6, 3 Stat. 314; Jan. 14, 1817, ch. 3, §1, 3 Stat. 344; Mar. 1, 1817, ch. 31, §6, 3 Stat. 352; Mar. 3, 1817, ch. 50, 3 Stat. 369; May 31, 1830, ch. 219, §1, 4 Stat. 425; July 14, 1862, ch. 163, §15, 12 Stat. 558; June 28, 1864, ch. 170, 13 Stat. 201; Mar. 3, 1865, ch. 80, §4, 13 Stat. 493.

The first and third paragraphs of this section, with the exception of the proviso in the third paragraph, are from R.S. §4219.

A portion of that section omitted here provided that, in addition to the tonnage duty thereby imposed there should be paid a tax, at the rate of thirty cents per ton, on vessels entered at any custom house from any foreign port or place.

It was probably omitted as superseded and repealed by act June 26, 1884, as amended by acts June 19, 1886, ch. 421, §11, 24 Stat. 81; Apr. 4, 1888, and Aug. 5, 1909.

Another portion of the original text, concerning the impairment of rights and privileges of foreign nations under laws and treaties was probably omitted as sufficiently covered by the similar provision near the end of the section.

The second paragraph of this section is from act Aug. 5, 1909, §36. Portions of that paragraph omitted here, fixed the time of its taking effect, repealed R.S. §4232, act June 19, 1886, ch. 421, §§11 and 12, 24 Stat. 81, and so much of R.S. §4219 as conflicted therewith, and provided that it should not be construed to amend or repeal R.S. §2792, as amended, act May 28, 1908, ch. 212, §5, 35 Stat. 425, or R.S. §2793. That paragraph was expressly excepted from repeal by Underwood Tariff Act Oct. 13, 1913, ch. 16, §IV, S, 38 Stat. 201.

The proviso in the third paragraph of this section is based on act Mar. 4, 1915. Other provisions of that act are classified to section 128 of this Appendix, and sections 128 and 131 of Title 19, Customs Duties.

So much of act June 19, 1886, ch. 421, §11, 24 Stat. 81, as exempted any yacht built outside the United States, and owned, chartered or used by a citizen of the United States, from the payment of tonnage taxes, was repealed by act Feb. 5, 1897, ch. 167, §2, 29 Stat. 511. Act June 19, 1886, having been repealed as above stated section 2 of act Feb. 5, 1897, ch. 167, is no longer operative.

Section 12 of act June 19, 1886, which was repealed by the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act of Aug. 5, 1909, §36, directed the President to cause the Governments of foreign countries, which, at any of their ports, imposed on American vessels a tonnage tax or light house dues, etc., to be informed of the provisions of section 11, and invited to co-operate with the Government of the United States in abolishing light house dues, etc.

R.S. §4223, provided that the tonnage duty imposed on all vessels engaged in foreign commerce should be levied but once within a year, and that when paid no further tonnage tax should be collected within one year from the date of such payment, not being applicable, however, to foreign vessels entered in the United States from any foreign port, to and with which vessels of the United States were not ordinarily permitted to enter and trade.

R.S. §4224, provided that vessels paying tonnage duties once a year should pay them at their first clearance from or entry at, according to priority, a custom house in the United States in each calendar year, but that it should not prevent customs officers from collecting such tonnage duty at the entry of vessels at their respective custom houses during the calendar year if the same had not previously been paid for such year.

Both these sections were repealed by act June 26, 1884, as amended by act June 19, 1886, ch. 421, §11, 24 Stat. 81.

Act June 19, 1878, ch. 318, 20 Stat. 171, amended R.S. §2931, by providing that it should not apply to cases of the payment of tonnage tax on vessels where the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General were satisfied that the exaction of the tax was in contravention of treaty provisions. R.S. §2931, which provided for an appeal to the Secretary of the Treasury from the decision of the collector of customs as to the rate and amount of tonnage duties, etc., was repealed by act June 10, 1890, ch. 407, §29, 26 Stat. 141. Act June 19, 1878, further provided that the Secretary of the Treasury might draw his warrant for the refund of taxes so illegally exacted, as provided for by R.S. §30121/2. R.S. §30121/2, was also repealed by act June 10, 1890, §29. By the repeal of R.S. §§2931, 30121/2, act June 19, 1878, ch. 318, became inoperative.

Act Feb. 10, 1900, ch. 15, §2, 31 Stat. 27, authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to refund tonnage taxes and light dues imposed on vessels owned by citizens of Cuba entering ports of the United States since Apr. 11, 1899, which had been in excess of the taxes prescribed by act June 19, 1886, ch. 421, §11, 24 Stat. 81. It was doubtless omitted from the code as executed.

R.S. §4232, repealed by the same section, provided that mail steamships employed in the mail-service between the United States and Brazil, should be exempt from all port charges and customs dues at the port of departure and arrival in the United States, if and so long as a similar immunity from port charges and custom-house charges was granted by the government of Brazil.

Section 37 of act Aug. 5, 1909, which provided for a tonnage tax on foreign built yachts, pleasure boats or vessels, not used or intended to be used for trade, owned, or chartered for more than six months by citizens of the United States, or, in lieu thereof, an ad valorem duty, and entitled such yachts, etc., upon payment thereof to all the privileges, subjected them to all the requirements prescribed by R.S. §§4214, 4215, 4217, 4218, and acts amendatory thereof, in the same manner as if they had been built in the United States, subjected such yachts, etc., to tonnage duty and light money only in the same manner as if they had been built in the United States, repealed so much of act May 28, 1908, ch. 212, §5, 35 Stat. 425, as related to yachts built outside the United States and owned by citizens of the United States, and provided that the section should not apply to foreign built vessels admitted to American registry, was repealed by the Underwood Tariff Act of Oct. 13, 1913, ch. 16, §IV, S, 38 Stat. 201.

Act June 5, 1920, ch. 250, §34, 41 Stat. 1007, directed the President to give notice to terminate provisions of treaties or conventions restricting the right of the United States to impose discriminating customs duties and tonnage dues.
It was doubtless omitted as temporary and executed.

Offsetting Receipts

Section 10402(c) of Pub. L. 101–508 provided that: “Increased tonnage charges collected as a result of the amendments made by subsection (a) [amending this section] shall be deposited in the general fund of the Treasury as offsetting receipts of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating and ascribed to Coast Guard activities.”

Nonliability of Customs Collectors and Vessels Before October 1, 1940

Act May 16, 1947, ch. 71, 61 Stat. 97, made collectors of customs and vessels themselves not liable for failure to collect special tonnage duties or light money under this section or section 128 of this Appendix in connection with the entry prior to Oct. 1, 1940, of any foreign vessel from a foreign port.

Section Referred to in Other Sections

§125. Vessels making daily trips on interior waters

Such light money shall be levied and collected in the same manner and under the same regulations as the tonnage duties: Provided, That no such duty shall be required where a vessel owned by citizens of the United States, but not a vessel of the United States, after entering an American port, shall, before leaving the same, be registered as a vessel of the United States.

§141. Suspension by President

Upon satisfactory proof being given to the President, by the government of any foreign nation, that no discriminating duties of tonnage or imposts are imposed or levied in the ports of such nation upon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States, or upon the produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported in the same from the United States or from any foreign country, the President may issue his proclamation, declaring that the foreign discriminating duties of tonnage and impost within the United States are suspended and discontinued, so far as respects the vessels of such foreign nation, and the produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported into the United States from such foreign nation, or from any other foreign country; the suspension to take effect from the time of such notification being given to the President, and to continue so long as the reciprocal exemption of vessels, belonging to citizens of the United States, and their cargoes, shall be continued, and no longer: Provided, That the President is authorized to suspend in part the operation of section 121 of this Appendix and section 2502 of the Revised Statutes so that foreign vessels from a country imposing partial discriminating tonnage duties upon American vessels, or partial discriminating import duties upon American merchandise, may enjoy in our ports the identical privileges which the same class of American vessels and merchandise may enjoy in said foreign country.

§142. Retaliatory suspension of commercial privileges to foreign vessels

Whenever any foreign country whose vessels have been placed on the same footing in the ports of the United States as American vessels (the coastwise trade excepted) shall deny to any vessels of the United States any of the commercial privileges accorded to national vessels in the harbors, ports, or waters of such foreign country, the President, on receiving satisfactory information of the continuance of such discriminations against any vessels of the United States, is authorized to issue his proclamation excluding, on and after such time as he may indicate, from the exercise of such commercial privileges in the ports of the United States as are denied to American vessels in the ports of such foreign country, all vessels of such foreign country of a similar character to the vessels of the United States thus discriminated against, and suspending such concessions previously granted to the vessels of such country; and on and after the date named in such proclamation for it to take effect, if the master, officer, or agent of any vessel of such foreign country excluded by said proclamation from the exercise of any commercial privileges shall do any act prohibited by said proclamation in the ports, harbors, or waters of the United States for or on account of such vessel, such vessel, and its rigging, tackle, furniture, and boats, and all the goods on board, shall be liable to seizure and to forfeiture to the United States; and any person opposing any officer of the United States in the enforcement of this section, or aiding and abetting any other person in such opposition, shall forfeit $800, and shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon conviction, shall be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.

§143. Retaliation on denial of rights to United States vessels in British North America

Whenever the President of the United States shall be satisfied that American fishing vessels or American fishermen, visiting or being in the waters or at any ports or places of the British dominions of North America, are or then lately have been denied or abridged in the enjoyment of any rights secured to them by treaty or law, or are or then lately have been unjustly vexed or harassed in the enjoyment of such rights, or subjected to unreasonable restrictions, regulations, or requirements in respect of such rights; or otherwise unjustly vexed or harassed in said waters, ports, or places; or whenever the President of the United States shall be satisfied that any such fishing vessels or fishermen, having a permit under the laws of the United States to touch and trade at any port or ports, place or places, in the British dominions of North America, are or then lately have been denied the privilege of entering such port or ports, place or places in the same manner and under the same regulations as may exist therein applicable to trading vessels of the most favored nation, or shall be unjustly vexed or harassed, in respect thereof, or otherwise be unjustly vexed or harassed therein, or shall be prevented from purchasing such supplies as may there be lawfully sold to trading vessels of the most favored nation; or whenever the President of the United States shall be satisfied that any other vessels of the United States, their masters, or crews, so arriving at or being in such British waters or ports or places of the British dominions of North America, are or then lately have been denied any of the privileges therein accorded to the vessels, their masters, or crews, of the most favored nation, or unjustly vexed or harassed in respect of the same, or unjustly vexed or harassed therein by the authorities thereof, then, and in either or all of such cases, it shall be lawful, and it shall be the duty of the President of the United States, in his discretion, by proclamation to that effect, to deny vessels, their masters and crews, of the British dominions of North America, any entrance into the waters, ports, or places of or within the United States (with such exceptions in regard to vessels in distress, stress of weather, or needing supplies as to the President shall seem proper), whether such vessel shall have come directly from said dominions on such destined voyage or by way of some port or place in such destined voyage elsewhere; and also to deny entry into any port or place of the United States of fresh fish or salt fish or any other product of said dominions, or other goods coming from said dominions to the United States.
The President may, in his discretion, apply such proclamation to any part or to all of the foregoing named subjects, and may revoke, qualify, limit, and renew such proclamation from time to time as he may deem necessary to the full and just execution of the purposes of this section.
Every violation of any such proclamation, or any part thereof, is declared illegal, and all vessels and goods so coming or being within the waters, ports, or places of the United States contrary to such proclamation shall be forfeited to the United States; and such forfeiture shall be enforced and proceeded upon in the same manner and with the same effect as in the case of vessels or goods whose importation or coming to or being in the waters or ports of the United States contrary to law may be enforced and proceeded upon.
Every person who shall violate any of the provisions of this section, or such proclamation of the President made in pursuance hereof, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000, or by imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court.

§144. Suspension of free passage through Saint Marys Falls Canal; tolls

With a view of securing reciprocal advantages for the citizens, ports, and vessels of the United States, whenever and so often as the President shall be satisfied that the passage through any canal or lock connected with the navigation of the Saint Lawrence River, the Great Lakes, or the water ways connecting the same, of any vessels of the United States, or of cargoes or passengers in transit to any port of the United States, is prohibited or is made difficult or burdensome by the imposition of tolls or otherwise which, in view of the free passage through the Saint Marys Falls Canal, permitted to vessels of all nations, he shall deem to be reciprocally unjust and unreasonable, he shall have the power, and it shall be his duty, to suspend by proclamation to that effect, for such time and to such extent (including absolute prohibition) as he shall deem just, the right of free passage through the Saint Marys Falls Canal, so far as it relates to vessels owned by the subjects of the Government so discriminating against the citizens, ports, or vessels of the United States, or to any cargoes, portions of cargoes, or passengers in transit to the ports of the Government making such discrimination, whether carried in vessels of the United States or of other nations.

In such case and during such suspension tolls shall be levied, collected, and paid as follows, to wit: Upon freight of whatever kind or description, not to exceed $2 per ton; upon passengers, not to exceed $5 each, as shall be from time to time determined by the President: Provided, That no tolls shall be charged or collected upon freight or passengers carried to and landed at Ogdensburg, or any port west of Ogdensburg, and south of a line drawn from the northern boundary of the State of New York through the Saint Lawrence River, the Great Lakes, and their connecting channels to the northern boundary of the State of Minnesota.

§146. Discriminating duty on merchandise imported in foreign vessels; exception

A discriminating duty of 10 per centum ad valorem, in addition to the duties imposed by law, shall be levied, collected, and paid on all goods, wares, or merchandise which shall be imported in vessels not of the United States; but this discriminating duty shall not apply to goods, wares, or merchandise which shall be imported in vessels not of the United States entitled at the time of such importation by treaty or any act of Congress to be entered in the ports of the United States on payment of the same duties as shall then be payable on goods, wares, and merchandise imported in vessels of the United States, nor to goods, wares, and merchandise imported in a vessel owned by citizens of the United States but not a vessel of the United States if such vessel after entering an American port shall, before leaving the same, be documented under chapter 121 of title 46.

(Oct. 3, 1913, ch. 16, §IV, J, subsec. 1, 38 Stat. 195; Mar. 4, 1915, ch. 171, §1, 38 Stat. 1193; June 17, 1930, ch. 497, title IV, §651(d)(1), 46 Stat. 763; Pub. L. 103–182, title VI, §689(a)(1), Dec. 8, 1993, 107 Stat. 2222.)

Section is a composite of acts Oct. 3, 1913, ch. 16, and Mar. 4, 1915, ch. 171, as amended.
The words “nor to goods, wares, and merchandise imported in a vessel owned by citizens of the United States but not a vessel of the United States if such vessel after entering an American port shall, before leaving the same, be documented under chapter 121 of title 46” are based on the nonspecific amendment of act Oct. 3, 1913, by act Mar. 4, 1915, as amended.

Subsec. 1 of act Oct. 3, 1913, §IV, par. J, provided also for a discriminating duty on goods, wares and merchandise produced or manufactured in a foreign country not contiguous to the United States but coming into the United States from such contiguous country.
That provision is classified to section 128 of Title 19.

R.S. §2502 imposed a discriminating duty upon merchandise imported in foreign vessels.
It was superseded by subsequent similar provisions in successive tariff acts, the latest of which is classified to this section.

Act June 5, 1920, ch. 250, §34, 41 Stat. 1007, declaring it to be the judgment of Congress that provisions of treaties restricting the right of the United States to impose discriminating customs duties on imports entering the United States in foreign vessels and vessels of the United States, and discriminatory tonnage dues on foreign vessels, and on vessels of the United States, should be terminated, and directing the President to give notice to terminate them, was omitted.

(b) Claims not barred for failure to give notice

Failure to give such notice, where lawfully prescribed in such contract, shall not bar any such claim—

(1) If the owner or master of the vessel or his agent had knowledge of the injury, damage, or loss and the court determines that the owner has not been prejudiced by the failure to give such notice; nor

(2) If the court excuses such failure on the ground that for some satisfactory reason such notice could not be given; nor

(3) Unless objection to such failure is raised by the owner.

(c) Mental incompetents; minors; wrongful death actions

If a person who is entitled to recover on any such claim is mentally incompetent or a minor, or if the action is one for wrongful death, any lawful limitation of time prescribed in such contract shall not be applicable so long as no legal representative has been appointed for such incompetent, minor, or decedent's estate, but shall be applicable from the date of the appointment of such legal representative: Provided, however, That such appointment be made within three years after the date of such death or injury.

(a) It shall be unlawful for the manager, agent, master, or owner of any vessel transporting passengers between ports of the United States or between any such port and a foreign port to insert in any rule, regulation, contract, or agreement any provision or limitation (1) purporting, in the event of loss of life or bodily injury arising from the negligence or fault of such owner or his servants, to relieve such owner, master, or agent from liability, or from liability beyond any stipulated amount, for such loss or injury, or (2) purporting in such event to lessen, weaken, or avoid the right of any claimant to a trial by court of competent jurisdiction on the question of liability for such loss or injury, or the measure of damages therefor.
All such provisions or limitations contained in any such rule, regulation, contract, or agreement are declared to be against public policy and shall be null and void and of no effect.

(b)(1) Subsection (a) of this section shall not prohibit provisions or limitations in contracts, agreements, or ticket conditions of carriage with passengers which relieve a crewmember, manager, agent, master, owner, or operator of a vessel from liability for infliction of emotional distress, mental suffering, or psychological injury so long as such provisions or limitations do not limit such liability if the emotional distress, mental suffering, or psychological injury was—

(A) the result of physical injury to the claimant caused by the negligence or fault of a crewmember or the manager, agent, master, owner, or operator;

(B) the result of the claimant having been at actual risk of physical injury, and such risk was caused by the negligence or fault of a crewmember or the manager, agent, master, owner, or operator; or

(C) intentionally inflicted by a crewmember or the manager, agent, master, owner, or operator.

(2) Nothing in this subsection is intended to limit the liability of a crewmember or the manager, agent, master, owner, or operator of a vessel in a case involving sexual harassment, sexual assault, or rape.

§184. Apportionment of compensation

Whenever any such embezzlement, loss, or destruction is suffered by several freighters or owners of goods, wares, merchandise, or any property whatever, on the same voyage, and the whole value of the vessel, and her freight for the voyage, is not sufficient to make compensation to each of them, they shall receive compensation from the owner of the vessel in proportion to their respective losses; and for that purpose the freighters and owners of the property, and the owner of the vessel, or any of them, may take the appropriate proceedings in any court, for the purpose of apportioning the sum for which the owner of the vessel may be liable among the parties entitled thereto.

No fish landed under this authorization shall be sold or transferred except for immediate consumption.
Sale or transfer to an agent, representative, or employee of a freezer or cannery shall be deemed to be prohibited in the absence of satisfactory evidence that such sale or transfer is for immediate consumption.
For the purposes of this subsection, the term “immediate consumption” shall not preclude the freezing, smoking, or other processing of such fresh fish by the ultimate consumer thereof.

“(a) The Shipping Act of 1916, as amended [section 801 et seq. of this Appendix], and the Intercoastal Shipping Act, 1933, as amended [section 843 et seq. of this Appendix], are repealed insofar as they are inconsistent with any provision of this chapter [section 901 et seq. of former Title 49, Transportation] and insofar as they provide for the regulation of, or the making of agreements relating to, transportation of persons or property by water in commerce which is within the jurisdiction of the Commission under the provisions of this chapter; and any other provisions of law are hereby repealed insofar as they are inconsistent with any provision of this chapter.

“(b) Nothing in subsection (a) of this section shall be construed to repeal—

“(1) section 1115 of Title 46 [46 App. U.S.C. 1115], or any provision of law providing penalties for violations of said section;

“(2) the third sentence of section 844 of Title 46 [46 App. U.S.C. 844], as extended by section 845b of Title 46 [46 App. U.S.C. 845b], or any provision of law providing penalties for violations of section 844 of Title 46;

“(3) the provisions of the Shipping Act of 1916, as amended [section 801 et seq. of this Appendix], insofar as such Act provides for the regulation of persons included within the term ‘other person subject to this Act’, as defined in such Act;

“(4) sections 883 and 884 of Title 46 [46 App. U.S.C. 883, 884].

“(c) Nothing in subsection (a) of this section shall be construed to affect the provisions of section 814 of Title 46 [46 App. U.S.C. 814] so as to prevent any water carrier subject to the provisions of this chapter from entering into any agreement under the provisions of said section with respect to transportation not subject to the provisions of this chapter in which such carrier may be engaged.

“(d) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to affect any law of navigation, the admiralty jurisdiction of the courts of the United States, liabilities of vessels and their owners for loss or damage, or laws respecting seamen, or any other maritime law, regulation, or custom not in conflict with the provisions of this chapter.”

(f) To cause or procure any vessel constructed in whole or in part within the United States, which has never cleared for any foreign port, to depart from a port of the United States before it has been documented under the laws of the United States.

§861. Purpose and policy of United States

It is necessary for the national defense and for the proper growth of its foreign and domestic commerce that the United States shall have a merchant marine of the best equipped and most suitable types of vessels sufficient to carry the greater portion of its commerce and serve as a naval or military auxiliary in time of war or national emergency, ultimately to be owned and operated privately by citizens of the United States; and it is declared to be the policy of the United States to do whatever may be necessary to develop and encourage the maintenance of such a merchant marine, and, insofar as may not be inconsistent with the express provisions of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation shall, in the disposition of vessels and shipping property as hereinafter provided, in the making of rules and regulations, and in the administration of the shipping laws keep always in view this purpose and object as the primary end to be attained.

§865a. Sale of inactive passenger vessels to foreigners; conditions; requisition in emergency; surety bond

Notwithstanding any other provision of law or of prior contract with the United States, any vessel heretofore operated as a passenger vessel, as defined in section 613(a) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended [46 App. U.S.C. 1183(a)], under an operating-differential subsidy contract with the United States and now in inactive or layup status, except the steamship Independence and the steamship United States, may be sold and transferred to foreign ownership, registry, and flag, with the prior approval of the Secretary of Transportation.
Such approval shall require (1) approval of the purchaser; (2) payment of existing debt and private obligations related to the vessel; (3) approval of the price, including terms of payment, for the sale of the vessel; (4) the seller to enter into an agreement with the Secretary whereby an amount equal to the net proceeds received from such sale in excess of existing obligations and expenses incident to the sale shall within a reasonable period not to exceed twelve months of receipt be committed and thereafter be used as equity capital for the construction of new vessels which the Secretary determines are built to effectuate the purposes and policy of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended [46 App. U.S.C. 1101 et seq.]; and (5) the purchaser to enter into an agreement with the Secretary, binding upon such purchaser and any later owner of the vessel and running with title to the vessel, that (a) the vessel will not carry passengers or cargo in competition, as determined by the Secretary, with any United States-flag passenger vessel for a period of two years from the date the transferred vessel goes into operation; (b) the vessel will be made available to the United States in time of emergency and just compensation for title or use; as the case may be, shall be paid in accordance with section 902 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (46 App. U.S.C. 1242); (c) the purchaser will comply with such further conditions as the Secretary may impose as authorized by sections 808, 835 and 839 of this Appendix; and (d) the purchaser will furnish a surety bond in an amount and with a surety satisfactory to the Secretary to secure performance of the foregoing agreements.

In addition to any other provision such agreements may contain for enforcement of (4) and (5) above, the agreements therein required may be specifically enforced by decree for specific performance or injunction in any district court of the United States.
In the agreement with the Secretary the purchaser shall irrevocably appoint a corporate agent within the United States for service of process upon such purchaser in any action to enforce the agreement.

§866. Establishment and operation of steamship lines between ports of United States

Investigation and determination by Secretary—The Secretary of Transportation is authorized and directed to investigate and determine as promptly as possible after June 5, 1920, and from time to time thereafter what steamship lines should be established and put in operation from ports in the United States or any Territory, District, or possession thereof to such world and domestic markets as in his judgment are desirable for the promotion, development, expansion, and maintenance of the foreign and coastwise trade of the United States and an adequate postal service, and to determine the type, size, speed, and other requirements of the vessels to be employed upon such lines and the frequency and regularity of their sailings, with a view to furnishing adequate, regular, certain, and permanent service.

Sale or charter of vessels—The Secretary of Transportation is authorized to sell, and if a satisfactory sale cannot be made, to charter such of the vessels referred to in section 863 of this Appendix or otherwise acquired by the Secretary of Transportation, as will meet these requirements to responsible persons who are citizens of the United States who agree to establish and maintain such lines upon such terms of payment and other conditions as the Secretary of Transportation may deem just and necessary to secure and maintain the service desired; and if any such steamship line is deemed desirable and necessary, and if no such citizen can be secured to supply such service by the purchase or charter of vessels on terms satisfactory to the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of Transportation shall operate vessels on such line until the business is developed so that such vessels may be sold on satisfactory terms and the service maintained, or unless it shall appear within a reasonable time that such line cannot be made self-sustaining.

Preference in sales or charters—Preference in the sale or assignment of vessels for operation on such steamship lines shall be given to persons who are citizens of the United States who have the support, financial and otherwise, of the domestic communities primarily interested in such lines if the Secretary of Transportation is satisfied of the ability of such persons to maintain the service desired and proposed to be maintained, or to persons who are citizens of the United States who may then be maintaining a service from the port of the United States to or in the general direction of the world-market port to which the Secretary of Transportation has determined that such service should be established.

Lines established by shipping board; continued operation—Where steamship lines and regular service had been established and were being maintained by ships of the United States Shipping Board on June 5, 1920, such lines and service shall be maintained by the Secretary of Commerce until, in the opinion of the Secretary, the maintenance thereof is unbusinesslike and against the public interests.

Additional lines established by Secretary; rates and charges—Whenever the Secretary of Transportation shall determine, as provided in this Act, that trade conditions warrant the establishment of a service or additional service under Government administration where a service is already being given by persons, citizens of the United States, the rates and charges for such Government service shall not be less than the cost thereof, including a proper interest and depreciation charge on the value of Government vessels and equipment employed therein.

§871. Repair and operation of vessels until sale

All vessels may be reconditioned and kept in suitable repair and until sold shall be managed and operated by the Secretary of Transportation or chartered or leased by him on such terms and conditions as the Secretary of Transportation shall deem wise for the promotion and maintenance of an efficient merchant marine, pursuant to the policy and purposes declared in section 861 of this Appendix and section 5 of this Act.1

The term “reconditioned” as used in this section includes the substitution of the most modern, most efficient, and most economical types of internal-combustion engines as the main propulsive power of vessels.
Should the Secretary of Transportation have any such engines built in the United States and installed, in private shipyards or navy yards of the United States, in one or more merchant vessels owned by the United States, and the cost to the Secretary of Transportation of such installation exceeds the amount of funds otherwise available to him for that use, the Secretary of Transportation may transfer to his funds from which expenditures under this section may be paid, from his construction fund authorized by section 11 1 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, so much as in his judgment may be necessary to meet obligations under contracts for such installation; and the Treasurer of the United States shall, at the request of the Secretary of Transportation, make the transfer accordingly: Provided, That the total amount expended by the Secretary of Transportation for this purpose shall not in the aggregate exceed $25,000,000. Any such vessel after June 5, 1920, so equipped by the Secretary of Transportation under the provisions of this section shall not be sold for a period of five years from the date the installation thereof is completed, unless it is sold for a price not less than the cost of the installation thereof and of any other work of reconditioning done at the same time plus an amount not less than $10 for each dead-weight ton of the vessel as computed before such reconditioning thereof is commenced.
The date of the completion of such installation and the amount of the dead-weight tonnage of the vessel shall be fixed by the Secretary of Transportation: Provided further, That in fixing the minimum price at which the vessel may thus be sold the Secretary of Transportation may deduct from the aggregate amount above prescribed 5 per centum thereof per annum from the date of the installation to the date of sale as depreciation: And provided further, That no part of such fund shall be expended upon the reconditioning of any vessel unless the Secretary of Transportation shall have first made a binding contract for a satisfactory sale of such vessel in accordance with the provisions of this Act, or for the charter or lease of such vessels for a period of not less than five years by a capable, solvent operator; or unless the Secretary of Transportation is prepared and intends to directly put such vessel in operation immediately upon completion.
Such vessel, in any of the enumerated instances, shall be documented under the laws of the United States and shall remain documented under such laws for a period of not less than five years from the date of the completion of the installation, and during such period it shall be operated only on voyages which are not exclusively coastwise.

The incineration equipment on these vessels shall meet all current United States Coast Guard and Environmental Protection Agency standards.
These vessels shall, in addition to any other inspections by the flag state, be inspected by the United States Coast Guard, including drydock inspections and internal examinations of tanks and void spaces, as would be required of a vessel of the United States.
Satisfactory inspection shall be certified in writing by the Secretary of Transportation.
Such inspections may occur concurrently with any inspections required by the flag state or subsequent to but no more than one year after the initial issuance or the next scheduled issuance of the Safety of Life at Sea Safety Construction Certificate.

No carrier shall charge, collect, or receive for transportation subject to subtitle IV of title 49 of persons or property, under any joint rate, fare, or charge, or under any export, import, or other proportional rate, fare, or charge, which is based in whole or in part on the fact that the persons or property affected thereby is to be transported to, or has been transported from, any port in a possession or dependency of the United States, or in a foreign country, by a carrier by water in foreign commerce, any lower rate, fare, or charge than that charged, collected, or received by it for the transportation of persons, or of a like kind of property, for the same distance, in the same direction, and over the same route, in connection with commerce wholly within the United States, unless the vessel so transporting such persons or property is, or unless it was at the time of such transportation by water, documented under the laws of the United States.
Whenever the Secretary of Transportation is of the opinion, however, that adequate shipping facilities to or from any port in a possession or dependency of the United States or a foreign country are not afforded by vessels so documented he shall certify this fact to the Surface Transportation Board, and the Board may, by order, suspend the operation of the provisions of this section with respect to the rates, fares, and charges for the transportation by rail of persons and property transported from, or to be transported to such ports, for such length of time and under such terms and conditions as he may prescribe in such order, or in any order supplemental thereto.

References in Text

The civil service laws, referred to in subsec. (e), are set out in Title 5, Government Organization and Employees.
See, particularly, section 3301 et seq. of Title 5.

Codification

Provisions of the first sentence of subsec. (e) that authorized the appointment and fixing of the salaries of a secretary, etc., “without regard to the civil-service laws or the Classification Act of 1923, as amended”, and provisions that prohibited such employees from receiving an annual salary at a rate in excess of that provided under the Classification Act of 1923, as amended, were omitted as obsolete and superseded.

Such appointments are now subject to the civil service laws unless specifically excepted by such laws or by laws enacted subsequent to Executive Order 8743, Apr. 23, 1941, issued by the President pursuant to the act of Nov. 26, 1940, ch. 919, title I, §1, 54 Stat. 1211, which covered most excepted positions into the classified (competitive) civil service.
The Order is set out as a note under section 3301 of Title 5, Government Organization and Employees.

As to the salaries of such personnel, sections 1202 and 1204 of the Classification Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 972, 973, repealed the Classification Act of 1923 and all other laws or parts of laws inconsistent with the 1949 Act.
The Classification Act of 1949 was repealed by Pub. L. 89–554, Sept. 6, 1966, §8(a), 80 Stat. 632, and reenacted as chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of Title 5. Section 5102 of Title 5 contains the applicability provisions of the 1949 Act, and section 5103 of Title 5 authorizes the Office of Personnel Management to determine the applicability to specific positions and employees.

In the last sentence of subsec. (e), “chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5” substituted for “the Classification Act of 1949, as amended” on authority of Pub. L. 89–554, §7(b), Sept. 6, 1966, 80 Stat. 631, the first section of which enacted Title 5.

Repeals

Act Oct. 28, 1949, ch. 782, cited as a credit to this section, was repealed (subject to a savings clause) by Pub. L. 89–554, Sept. 6, 1966, §8, 80 Stat. 632, 655.

Message of the President

To the Congress of the United States:

I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 7 of 1961, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended, and providing for the reorganization of maritime functions.

The basic objective of the plan is to strengthen and revitalize the administration of our Federal programs concerned with the promotion and development of the U.S. merchant marine by concentrating responsibility in separate agencies for the performance of regulatory and promotional functions.
The plan provides, therefore, for the creation of a separate Federal Maritime Commission, composed of five Commissioners, which would be charged with the regulatory functions of the present Federal Maritime Board.
There would be transferred from the Federal Maritime Board to the Secretary of Commerce the award of subsidies and related promotional functions.
The Secretary of Commerce would retain the functions transferred to him by Reorganization Plan No. 21 of 1950 which reorganized the U.S. Maritime Commission into a Federal Maritime Board and a Maritime Administration in the Department of Commerce.
The plan retains the present Maritime Administration, provides for an Administrator as head thereof, retains a Deputy Maritime Administrator, and effects no change in the Office of the Under Secretary of Commerce for Transportation.
The Federal Maritime Board is abolished.

Existing organizational arrangements have not proved to be satisfactory.
The development and maintenance of a sound maritime industry require that the Federal Government carry out its dual responsibilities for regulation and promotion with equal vigor and effectiveness.
Intermingling of regulatory and promotional functions has tended in this instance to dilute responsibility and has led to serious inadequacies, particularly in the administration of regulatory functions.
Recent findings by committees of the Congress disclose serious violations of maritime laws and point to the urgent need for a reorganization to vest in completely separate agencies a responsibility for (1) regulatory functions and (2) promotional and operating functions.

The plan would provide the most appropriate organizational framework for each of the functions concerned.
Regulation would be made the exclusive responsibility of a separate commission organized along the general lines of other regulatory agencies.
On the other hand, nonregulatory functions, including the determination and award of subsidies and other promotional and operating activities, would be concentrated in the head of the Department of Commerce.
The Secretary of Commerce is best qualified to coordinate these activities with other transportation and related economic programs.

The vesting of all subsidy functions in the Secretary of Commerce will make it possible for the Congress and the President to hold a single official responsible and accountable for the effective conduct of all aspects of this program, including the size and character of the fleet under the U.S. flag, the need for Government assistance, and requirements for appropriations to support subsidy programs.
Furthermore, the placing of these functions in the Secretary of Commerce will assure essential supervision and review of subsidy awards.

The taking effect of the reorganizations included in the accompanying reorganization plan will result in a modest increase in expenditures.
The improved organizational alinements provided by the plan will, however, make possible a more effective and expeditious administration of the statutory objectives to foster and promote a U.S. merchant marine capable of meeting the Nation's needs in peace and war.
Failure to meet these objectives would be far more costly than the anticipated increase in expenditures under the plan.

After investigation, I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 7 of 1961 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.

I have also found and hereby declare that it is necessary to include in the accompanying reorganization plan, by reason of reorganizations made thereby, provisions for the appointment and compensation of new officers specified in sections 102 and 201 of the plan.
The rates of compensation fixed for these officers are, respectively, those which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable officers in the executive branch of the Government.

I recommend that the Congress allow the reorganization plan to become effective.

Plan No. 5 of 1950.]

Message of the President

To the Congress of the United States:

I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 21 of 1950, prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949. This plan effects a basic reorganization of the functions of the United States Maritime Commission along the lines recommended by the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government.

Within the last 3 years three different bodies have studied the administration of the Maritime Commission.
All have concluded that the operating deficiencies of the agency arise from inappropriate and unsound organization and that a fundamental reorganization is essential.
The first of these bodies, the President's Advisory Committee on the Merchant Marine, in 1947, stated:

It appears to the Committee that the organization structure of the Maritime Commission as set up in the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 is wholly inadequate for the efficient conduct of the multitude of diverse activities for which the Maritime Commission is now responsible.
The deficiencies of the statutory organization for administrative action are regarded by the Committee to be the most serious obstacle standing in the way of the development of the Merchant Marine of this country.

Similarly, the survey of the Maritime Commission in 1948 for the Senate Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments concluded that—

The fundamental weakness of the Maritime Commission, as it is now constituted, lies in its proscribed organization.

On the basis of investigations of the Maritime Commission by two of its task forces, the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch stated:

It is an anomaly that a regulatory commission should also conduct the executive function of managing a huge business; that executive functions should be carried on by an agency that is not subject to Presidential directions; that executive functions should be carried on by a full-time board * * *.

While the recommendations of the various studies differ in some details, they agree on principles and on the main features of reorganization.

Basically, the administrative difficulties of the Maritime Commission have arisen, as all these studies agree, from the fact that the Commission is responsible for performing two fundamentally different types of functions which call for different types of organization.
These two classes of functions are (a) regulatory and (b) operating and promotional.
Under various acts the Commission regulates rates and services of water carriers; passes on agreements among carriers; and protects shippers against unfair and discriminatory practices.
This type of activity requires the deliberation and independence of judgment which a board or commission is especially well designed to provide.
But at the same time the Commission is charged with the conduct of a variety of large and costly promotional and business-type programs demanding the prompt and vigorous administration for which experience both in Government and in private enterprise has demonstrated that a single executive is essential.

The Maritime Commission has charge of the construction of merchant vessels for subsidized operators and for Government account.
It owns and maintains the largest merchant fleet in the world, consisting of 2,200 vessels aggregating more than 22,000,000 dead-weight tons.
It charters and sells ships and, in time of war or national emergency, requisitions and operates vessels for the Government.
It grants construction and operating differential subsidies to private shipping companies to maintain an active privately operated American merchant marine.
It makes loans and insures mortgages to assist carriers in acquiring new vessels, and it conducts programs for training officers and seamen for the merchant marine.
For the present fiscal year the performance of these functions will involve the expenditure of approximately $162,000,000 and the direction of an organization of 5,500 employees.
In short, the administration of the Maritime Commission is a vast business undertaking.
Moreover, the work of the Commission affects significantly the interests of both business and labor in the maintenance of a sound maritime industry.

Further than this, many of the activities of the Maritime Commission are closely related to other programs of the Government and have to be coordinated with them.
In the construction of a subsidized ship the Commission must cooperate with the Coast Guard on those features of design, materials, and equipment which affect the safety of the vessel and with the Navy on those which especially affect the use of the ship for national defense.
Furthermore, the whole program of subsidized ship construction needs to be adjusted to the plans and requirements for national defense.
At the same time the Commission's programs for the development of the merchant marine must be coordinated with our foreign policy and with Federal programs with respect to other branches of transportation.

While an independent commission is an appropriate instrument for the performance of the regulatory functions of the Maritime Commission, such an agency obviously is not the type required to provide strong and efficient administration of the large operating programs now entrusted to the Commission or to obtain the needed coordination with other activities of the executive branch.
This fact is amply demonstrated by the administrative difficulties and the complicated problems of coordination encountered in the operation of the Commission since the war and by the necessity of transferring a large part of its functions to the War Shipping Administration, headed by a single executive, during the war.

Briefly, this reorganization plan provides for a small Federal Maritime Board and a Maritime Administration in the Department of Commerce to perform the functions of the Maritime Commission, and abolishes the existing Commission.
It transfers to the Board the regulatory functions of the Commission and definitely guarantees the independence of the Board in the performance of these functions.
In addition, it vests directly in the Board the determination and award of construction and operating differential subsidies.
In the performance of its subsidy functions the Board will be subject to general policy guidance by the Secretary of Commerce.
The Board, however, and it alone, will determine to whom subsidies shall be granted and will make and award the subsidy contracts.
Its actions therein will be conclusive and will not be subject to modification by any other agency or officer of the Department of Commerce.
The other functions of the Maritime Commission, including carrying out the subsidy agreements made by the Board and administering the various operating programs, are transferred to the Secretary of Commerce for administration through the Maritime Administration.
Thus, the plan provides for each of the two types of functions now vested in the Maritime Commission the type of organization best suited to its performance.
At the same time, the plan will facilitate coordination of maritime policies and programs with other related policies and programs.

The division of functions under this plan conforms directly to the recommendations of the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government.
While the award of subsidies is a promotional rather than a regulatory function and might logically be assigned to the Maritime Administration instead of the Board, its impact on the shipping industry and on individual carriers is such as to make desirable the deliberation and combined judgment of a board.
Accordingly, I have adhered to the recommendation of the Commission on Organization that this function be vested in a multiple body rather than a single official.
Likewise, in line with the recommendations of the Commission, the plan assigns the determination of the over-all route pattern to the Secretary of Commerce.

The Maritime Board will consist of three members appointed by the President with the consent of the Senate for overlapping terms of 4 years.
Not more than two of the members can be of the same political party.
The Board, therefore, will be a smaller and more wieldy body which can function with greater expedition and efficiency than the existing five-member Commission.
The Chairman will be designated by the President from the members of the Board and will be, ex officio, the Maritime Administrator and as such the head of the Maritime Administration.
The plan also provides for a Deputy Maritime Administrator appointed by the Secretary of Commerce under the classified civil service.
After investigation I have found, and hereby declare, that by reason of the reorganizations made by this plan, it is necessary to include in the plan provisions for the appointment and compensation of the members of the Federal Maritime Board and for the appointment of the Deputy Maritime Administrator.

In making the Chairman of the Federal Maritime Board the Maritime Administrator, the plan adopts an arrangement substantially similar to that which prevailed during the war, when the same individual served as Chairman of the Maritime Commission and head of the War Shipping Administration.
This arrangement will have important advantages.
It will facilitate cooperation between the Board and the Administration on matters of concern to both.
Also, it will avoid dividing the personnel of the Maritime Commission, since the Chairman of the Board will supervise the personnel assisting it in the performance of its functions, as is now the case in the Maritime Commission, and in his capacity as Administrator he will have charge of the personnel carrying on the work of the Maritime Administration.
The plan provides for the joint operation of the officers and employees under the Administrator and Chairman as a single body of personnel.
The maintenance of a unified staff is essential for efficient and economical administration because many of the technical and professional personnel, such as ship designers and attorneys, now assist the Maritime Commission on problems of subsidy determination and also participate in the subsequent administration of subsidy agreements and in performing nonsubsidy functions.

The inclusion of the new Board in the Department of Commerce will permit the use of the administrative services of the Department.
More important, it will eliminate the necessity of splitting the personnel of the Maritime Commission between the Department and an outside agency.
In addition, it will relieve the President of having to handle relations with a separate maritime agency.

In establishing the Department of Commerce the Congress provided in the organic act of the Department that—

It shall be the province and duty of said Department to foster, promote, and develop the foreign and domestic commerce, * * * shipping, * * * and the transportation facilities of the United States.

Over the years, however, transportation functions have become widely scattered throughout the executive branch.
As a result, intelligent planning and budgeting of Federal transportation activities and the necessary coordination of transportation programs have become extremely difficult or impossible.
The transfer of the functions of the Maritime Commission to the Department of Commerce will constitute a major step in correcting this condition.

Without question the Department of Commerce is now the appropriate center for transportation programs.
It contains the Civil Aeronautics Administration—the major operating and promotional agency of the Government in the field of air transportation—and the Weather Bureau, and the Coast and Geodetic Survey, which provide vital services to transportation.
As a result of Reorganization Plan No. 7 of 1949, it now also includes the Bureau of Public Roads, the leading promotional agency dealing with land transportation.
Also, it has the Inland Waterways Corporation in the field of water transportation.
The transfer of the functions of the Maritime Commission will bring into the Department the principal water-transportation agency of the Government.
These actions will go a long way toward the establishment of a sound and effective organization for the operating and promotional programs of the Government relating to transportation.

It is my purpose to look to the Secretary of Commerce for leadership with respect to transportation problems and for the development of over-all transportation policy within the executive branch.
Because of the magnitude and importance of the transportation functions transferred to the Department of Commerce by this reorganization plan, I have found and hereby declare that it is necessary to strengthen the top administrative structure of the Department by providing for the appointment and compensation of a new Under Secretary of Commerce for Transportation.
This will make available an officer of the highest rank to assist the Secretary in supervising the varied and complex transportation programs of the Department and providing central leadership in transportation matters.
With the many responsibilities of the Secretary of Commerce in other areas, the creation of this office is essential to enable him properly to fulfill his obligations with respect to transportation.

After careful investigation I have found and I hereby declare that each of the reorganizations contained in this reorganization plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949. The rates of compensation fixed by the provisions of the reorganization plan for the Under Secretary of Commerce for Transportation, the Chairman, and the other two members of the Federal Maritime Board are, respectively, those which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable officers in the executive branch of the Government.

In summary, the reorganizations provided by this plan will have the following principal advantages: They will provide an efficient organization headed by a single responsible official to administer the large operating and business-type programs of the Maritime Commission.
At the same time, they will preserve the benefits of a bipartisan board for the performance of the regulatory functions of the Commission and the determination of subsidies.
They will reduce the number of agencies reporting directly to the President and simplify the over-all management of the executive branch.
In doing so, they will provide more adequate machinery for supervising the administration of the maritime programs and will facilitate their coordination with related policies and programs of the executive branch.
Finally, they will accomplish a major advance in the development of an effective organization of Federal transportation programs in accord with the recommendations of the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government.
While it is impossible to estimate in advance the savings which will be brought about by this plan, the improvements in administrative efficiency resulting from it should produce substantial reductions in expenditures for the programs transferred by the plan.

REORGANIZATION PLAN NO. 6 OF 1949

Eff.
Aug. 20, 1949, 14 F.R. 5228, 63 Stat. 1069

Prepared by the President and transmitted to the Senate and the House of Representatives in Congress assembled, June 20, 1949, pursuant to the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949, approved June 20, 1949 [see 5 U.S.C. 901 et seq.].

UNITED STATES MARITIME COMMISSION

Section 1. Administration of Functions of Commission

The Chairman of the United States Maritime Commission shall be the chief executive and administrative officer of the United States Maritime Commission.

Sec. 2. Transfer of Functions

There are hereby transferred from the United States Maritime Commission to the Chairman of the Commission the functions of the Commission with respect to (1) the appointment and supervision of all personnel employed under the Commission, (2) the distribution of business among such personnel and among organizational units of the Commission, and (3) the use and expenditure of funds for administrative purposes: Provided, That the provisions of this section do not extend to personnel employed regularly and full time in the offices of members of the Commission other than the Chairman: Provided further, That the heads of the major administrative units shall be appointed by the Chairman only after consultation with the other members of the Commission.

Sec. 3. Performance of Transferred Functions

The functions of the Chairman under the provisions of this reorganization plan shall be performed by him or, subject to his supervision and direction, by such officers and employees under his jurisdiction as he shall designate.

Message of the President

To the Congress of the United States:

I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 6 of 1949, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949. This plan is designed to strengthen the administration of the United States Maritime Commission by making the Chairman and the chief executive and administrative officer of the Commission and vesting in him responsibility for the appointment of its personnel and the supervision and direction of their activities.
After investigation, I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in this plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949.

Unlike other major regulatory commissions, the Maritime Commission is responsible not only for the performance of important regulatory functions but also for the administration of large and complex operating and promotional programs.
Whereas the budgets of most regulatory agencies amount to only a few million dollars annually, the expenditures of the Maritime Commission exceed $130,000,000 a year.
As a result of the war the Commission is the owner of a fleet of over 2,300 ships, aggregating more than 23,000,000 dead-weight tons.

While it is the policy of the Government, as set forth by the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 and the Merchant Ship Sales Act of 1946, to develop and maintain an adequate and effective merchant marine under private ownership, the Commission is still confronted with the necessity of carrying on substantial programs for the charter and sale of Government-owned vessels and with the continuing task of maintaining the reserve merchant fleet.

Apart from its functions with respect to the war-built fleet, the accomplishment of the Government's permanent objective with respect to the development of the American merchant marine inevitably involves the Commission to a wide variety of activities.
Among these are the regulation of rates and competitive practices of water carriers, the determination of essential trade routes and services, the award of subsidies to offset differences between American and foreign costs, the design and construction of ships, the inspection of subsidized vessels, and the training of seamen.

In the last 2 years the operation of the Maritime Commission has been subjected to independent examination by three bodies—the President's Advisory Committee on the Merchant Marine, the Senate Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments, and the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government.
All of these studies have pointed to difficulties in the conduct of the Commission's business and the necessity of improved organization to strengthen the administration of the agencies.
The remedies proposed have differed in some respects, but all the studies have emphasized the need of concentrating in a single official the management of a large part of the agency's work.

During the war such a concentration was temporarily accomplished by Executive order under the authority of the First War Powers Act.
In effect, the Chairman of the Commission, as War Shipping Administrator, was made directly responsible for the administration of several major operating programs of the Commission.
This arrangement proved its value under the stress of war.
About a year after the end of the fighting, however, it was terminated and the organization reverted to the prewar pattern.

As a result of postwar experience, the Commission appointed a general manager in 1948. While this has brought considerable improvement, it has not extricated the Commission from administration to the degree which is desirable.

After careful consideration of the problems involved in improving the operation of the Maritime Commission, I have concluded that the proper action at this time is to concentrate in the Chairman the responsibility for the internal administration of the agency.
This is achieved by the proposed reorganization plan by transferring to the Chairman the appointment of the personnel of the agency, except for the immediate assistants of the Commissioners, and the supervision and direction of their work.
This is substantially the arrangement recommended for regulatory commissions by the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government.

Such a plan of organization has many advantages.
It leaves in the Commission as a body the performance of regulatory functions, the determination of subsidies, and the determination of major policies.
Thus, it utilizes the Commission for the type of work for which such a body is best adapted.
At the same time the plan places under a single official the day-to-day direction of the work of the staff within the policies and determinations adopted by the Commission in the exercise of its functions.
This will provide more businesslike administration and help to overcome the delays, backlogs, and operating difficulties which have hampered the agency.
At the same time by freeing the members of the Commission of much detail, the plan will enable them to concentrate on major questions of policy and program and thereby will obtain earlier and better considered resolution of the basic problems of the agency.

Though the taking effect of this plan in itself may not result in substantial immediate economies, it is probable that the improved organizational arrangements will bring about, over a period of time, improved operations and substantially reduced expenditures.
An itemization of these reductions, however, in advance if actual experience under the plan is not practicable.

I am convinced that this reorganization plan will contribute importantly to the more businesslike and efficient administration of the programs of the Maritime Commission.

Federal Maritime Board and Maritime Administration

The following is a statement, in part, of the Department of Commerce, relating to the organization and functions of the Federal Maritime Board, and the Maritime Administration, created by Reorg.
Plan No. 21 of 1950, set out above, as such statement appeared in 16 F.R. 44 to 46, Jan. 3, 1951:

The statement of organization and functions of the Maritime Administration issued in 15 F.R. 4454–4457 is hereby revoked and the following substituted therefor:

1. Establishment.
The Federal Maritime Board and the Maritime Administration were established in the Department of Commerce by Reorganization Plan No. 21 of 1950, effective May 24, 1950 [set out above]. In performance of their functions the Federal Maritime Board and the Maritime Administration are guided by the broad declaration of policy stated in Title I of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 (49 Stat. 1985) [46 U.S.C. 1101], reaffirmed in section 2 of the Merchant Ship Sales Act, 1946 (60 Stat. 41) [50 App. U.S.C. 1735] * * *.

2. Organization of the Federal Maritime Board.
The Federal Maritime Board is composed of three members appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.
The President designates one of the members to serve as Chairman of the Federal Maritime Board.
The Chairman serves as chief executive and administrative officer of the Federal Maritime Board.
Any two members in office constitute a quorum for the transaction of the business of the Federal Maritime Board, and the affirmative votes of any two members are sufficient for the disposition of any matter which may come before the Federal Maritime Board.

The Federal Maritime Board has the following organizational components: (a) Office of the Chairman of the Federal Maritime Board; (b) Offices of the Members of the Federal Maritime Board; (c) Secretary's Office; (d) Regulation Office; and (e) Hearing Examiners’ Office.

Insofar as he deems desirable, the Chairman of the Federal Maritime Board makes use of the officers and employees of the Maritime Administration to perform activities for the Federal Maritime Board.

3. Functions of the Federal Maritime Board—(a) Regulatory functions.
Under Reorganization Plan No. 21 of 1950 the Federal Maritime Board is independent of the Secretary of Commerce in the performance of the following functions: (1) All functions under the provisions of sections 14 to 20, inclusive, and sections 22 to 33, inclusive, of the Shipping Act, 1916, as amended [former 46 U.S.C. 812–819, 821–832], including such functions with respect to the regulation and control of rates, services, practices, and agreements of common carriers by water and of other persons;

(2) All functions with respect to the regulation and control of rates, fares, charges, classifications, tariffs, regulations, and practices of common carriers by water under the provisions of the Intercoastal Shipping Act, 1933, as amended [former 46 U.S.C. 843–848];

(3) The functions with respect to the making of rules and regulations affecting shipping in the foreign trade to adjust or meet conditions unfavorable to such shipping, and with respect to the approval, suspension, modification, or annulment of rules or regulations of other Federal agencies affecting shipping in the foreign trade, under the provisions of section 19 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, as amended [46 U.S.C. 876], exclusive of subsection (1)(a) thereof;

(4) The functions with respect to investigating discriminatory rates, charges, classifications, and practices in the foreign trade, and with respect to recommending legislation to correct such discrimination, under the provisions of section 212(e) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 [46 U.S.C. 1122(e)]; and

(5) So much of the functions with respect to requiring the filing of reports, accounts, records, rates, charges, and memoranda, under the provisions of section 21 of the Shipping Act, 1916, as amended [former 46 U.S.C. 820], as relates to its functions under items (1) through (4), above.

(b) Subsidy contracts.
Under Reorganization Plan No. 21 of 1950 the Federal Maritime Board is guided by the general policies of the Secretary of Commerce in performing the following functions: (1) The functions with respect to making, amending, and terminating construction (reconstruction or reconditioning) differential subsidy contracts, including contracts for the construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of vessels and contracts for the sale of vessels to subsidy applicants or contracts to pay a differential subsidy and the cost of national defense features.
In the exercise of this function the Federal Maritime Board investigates and determines the relative cost of construction of comparable vessels in the United States and foreign countries and the extent and character of aids and subsidies granted by foreign governments to their merchant marines;

(2) The functions with respect to making, amending, and terminating operating differential subsidy contracts and, subsequent to entering into an operating differential subsidy contract, making determinations with respect to employment and wage conditions, and taking action on readjustment of operating cost differentials and the sale, assignment, or transfer of the contract.
In the exercise of this function the Federal Maritime Board investigates and determines the relative cost of operating vessels under the registry of the United States and under foreign registry, and the extent and character of aids and subsidies granted by foreign governments to their merchant marines;

(3) The functions with respect to investigating and reporting on relative construction and operating costs in the United States and foreign maritime countries, and the relative advantages of operating under United States or foreign registry, and on marine insurance, navigation laws, and vessel mortgages as authorized under section 12 of the Shipping Act, 1916 [former 46 U.S.C. 811]; and

(4) The functions with respect to requiring the filing of reports, accounts, records, rates, charges, and memoranda as relates to its functions as set forth in items (1), (2), and (3), above.

(c) Charters under the Merchant Ship Sales Act, 1946. The Federal Maritime Board makes determinations, after public hearings, as to whether the bareboat charter of warbuilt dry cargo vessels owned by the United States is required in the public interest in any service then not adequately served and for which privately owned American-flag vessels are not available for charter by private operators on reasonable conditions and rates, and certifies its findings to the Secretary of Commerce together with any restrictions and conditions which it determines to be necessary or appropriate to protect the public interest in respect to such charters and to protect privately owned vessels against competition from Government vessels chartered by the Secretary of Commerce.
All such charters are reviewed annually by the Federal Maritime Board for the purpose of making recommendations to the Secretary of Commerce as to whether conditions exist justifying the continuance of the charters.
The functions of the Secretary of Commerce with respect to the chartering of vessels has been delegated to the Maritime Administrator.

(d) War risk insurance.
Pursuant to Public Law 763, 81st Congress [46 U.S.C. 1281–1294], the Federal Maritime Board makes determinations of the fair and reasonable value of vessels insured under the provisions of Title XII of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended [46 U.S.C. 1281–1294]. The Secretary of Commerce may not settle an insurance claim with respect to a vessel in an amount in excess of the vessel's fair and reasonable value as determined by the Federal Maritime Board.

(e) In carrying out its functions under paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d), above, the Federal Maritime Board adopts rules and regulations; makes reports and recommendations to Congress; subpoenas witnesses; administers oaths; takes evidence; requires the production of books, papers and documents as necessary; issues opinions; promulgates orders; engages in enforcement and other legal proceedings; and performs all functions formerly performable by the Maritime Commission, which have been transferred to the Federal Maritime Board pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. 21 of 1950.

Appointment of Personnel

The following is a legal opinion, in part, dated August 29, 1950, and prepared by the General Counsel of the Maritime Administration, with respect to the authority of the chairman of the Federal Maritime Board to make appointments of personnel under the Board and the extent of the authority of the Secretary of Commerce under Reorg.
Plan No. 21 of 1950, set out above, as to such personnel:

Sec. 103 of Reorganization Plan 21 of 1950 [set out above] transferred to the Chairman of the Federal Maritime Board “all functions of the Chairman of the United States Maritime Commission (including his functions under the provisions of Reorganization Plan No. 6 of 1949 [set out above]) with respect to the functions transferred to the Board by the provisions of Sections 104 and 105” of Plan 21. Section 104 transferred to the Board the regulatory functions of the Maritime Commission and Section 105 transferred certain of the subsidy functions of the Commission, not including, however, the function of administering subsidy contracts.

Sec. 106 of Plan 21 provides for the status of the Board and of the Chairman and their relationship to the Secretary of Commerce. * * *.

In order to fully understand the intent of Plan 21, it is necessary to examine the status of the appointing authority of the Chairman of the Maritime Commission immediately prior to the transfer of functions under Plan 21. As set forth above, Section 103 of Plan 21 makes specific reference to the authority of the Chairman of the Commission under Plan 6 of 1949 as being transferred to the Chairman of the Board.

Reorganization Plan 6 was transmitted by the President to Congress on June 20, 1949. Its purpose as stated in the message of transmittal [set out in Appendix to Title 5, Government Organization and Employees] was “to strengthen the administration of the United States Maritime Commission by making the Chairman the chief executive and administrative officer of the Commission and vesting in him responsibility for the appointment of its personnel and the supervision and direction of their activities.” (Emphasis supplied.)

Section 2 of Plan 6 transferred from the Commission to the Chairman certain functions including the appointment of personnel (exclusive of “personnel employed regularly and full time” in the offices of other members) with the proviso that the Chairman would consult with other members before appointing the heads of major administration units.
Section 1 of Plan 6 provided that in exercising certain functions the Chairman should be guided by policies of the Commission.
This section significantly excepted from such requirement the authority transferred to the Chairman under Section 2 including the appointive authority.
Thus the appointive authority (excluding only personnel in offices of Commission members) was exclusively and, except for the proviso relating to heads of major units, unconditionally vested in the Chairman of the Commission until Plan 21 took effect.

Plan 21 transferred all the functions of the Commission and of the Chairman of the Commission.
As stated above, some of these functions went to the Federal Maritime Board (Secs. 104, 105). Others were transferred to the Chairman of the Board (Sec. 103). Functions not otherwise transferred went to the Secretary of Commerce (Sec. 204).

The functions transferred to the Board and to the Chairman relate to regulatory authority (to be exercised independently) and subsidy functions (to be exercised subject to the guidance of general policies established by the Secretary of Commerce). As Section 103 transferring functions to the Chairman relating to these subjects makes specific reference to the authority of the Chairman of the Commission under Plan 6, which included the appointment of personnel, it appears evident that so much of the appointive power as relates to personnel performing these functions passed to the Chairman of the Board to be exercised by him independently as to personnel performing regulatory functions and subject to the injunction of Sec. 106 (to be guided by the policies of the Secretary of Commerce) as to personnel performing services in connection with the subsidy functions performed by the Board.

This conclusion is reinforced by reference to a decision of the Attorney General to the Secretary of Commerce, dated May 13, 1940, construing somewhat similar provisions in a reorganization plan transferring to the Department certain functions of the Civil Aeronautics Authority [Reorg.
Plan No. IV of 1940, §7, eff.
June 30, 1940, 5 F.R. 2421, 54 Stat. 1234, set out in the Appendix to Title 5, Government Organization and Employees] * * *. Despite the specific mention of the personnel functions the Attorney General held that the appointive authority was in the Board.
This decision was based upon reasoning recognizing the practical fact that independence in the exercise of the functions of the Board could not be achieved if the control of personnel and finances of the Board were in the Secretary of Commerce.

I have reached the conclusion that the appointive authority as to personnel engaged in regulatory and certain of the subsidy functions is vested in the Chairman, notwithstanding certain facts which might tend to indicate a different result.

Chief among these is the statement contained in the President's message transmitting Plan 21, as follows:

“In making the Chairman of the Federal Maritime Board the Maritime Administrator, the plan adopts an arrangement substantially similar to that which prevailed during the war, when the same individual served as Chairman of the Maritime Commission and head of the War Shipping Administration.
This arrangement will have important advantages.
It will facilitate cooperation between the Board and the Administration on matters of concern to both.
Also, it will avoid dividing the personnel of the Maritime Commission, since the Chairman of the Board will supervise the personnel assisting it in the performance of its functions, as is now the case in the Maritime Commission, and in his capacity as Administrator he will have charge of the personnel carrying on the work of the Maritime Administration.
The plan provides for the joint operation of the officers and employees under the Administrator and Chairman as a single body of personnel.
The maintenance of a unified staff is essential for efficient and economical administration because many of the technical and professional personnel, such as ship designers and attorneys, now assist the Maritime Commission on problems of subsidy determination and also participate in the subsequent administration of subsidy agreements and in performing nonsubsidy functions.

“The inclusion of the new Board in the Department of Commerce will permit the use of the administrative services of the Department.
More important, it will eliminate the necessity of splitting the personnel of the Maritime Commission between the Department and an outside agency. * * *”.

A literal reading of portions of this statement might be used as a basis for argument that a single appointive authority was intended.
This meaning cannot be given the statement, however, in view of the specific language of the Plan as previously discussed.
It is more likely that the President had in mind the fact that the Plan seems to contemplate a delegation of authority from the Secretary to the Chairman-Administrator by providing in Sec. 204 that “The Secretary of Commerce may from time to time make such provisions as he shall deem appropriate authorizing the performance by the Maritime Administrator of any function transferred to such Secretary by the provisions of this reorganization plan.” Sec. 302 provides that the Chairman-Administrator shall make joint use of personnel.

Another argument against the conclusion stated could be based upon the fact that Plan 21 makes specific reference in transferring functions to the Board of certain titles and portions of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended [this chapter], without making any reference to Sec. 201(e) of that Act [subsec. (e) of this section] which is the source of the appointive authority formerly vested in the Commission.
This argument fails, however, when consideration is given to the fact that immediately prior to Plan 21 this authority was vested not in the Commission but in the Chairman of the Commission under Plan 6 and is included in the specific reference to Plan 6.

It is clear that both Plan 21 and the President's transmittal message contemplate the use of personnel to perform dual functions for the Board and for the Administrator.
It is equally clear that the Plan itself does not contain provisions vesting in a single appointive authority the power to establish such a group of personnel.
It is evident, therefore, that the President contemplated that this objective be achieved by the Chairman's voluntarily utilizing the services of employees appointed under the authority of the Secretary to perform services in connection with Board functions and, in his capacity as Administrator, utilizing the services of employees employed by him under the direct grant of authority in the Plan to perform duties assigned to him by the Secretary.
Thus the Plan, although directing the joint use of personnel, intends that result to be accomplished through the use of the administrative discretion granted the Chairman-Administrator by Section 302 of the Plan to be exercised in the interest of economy and efficiency, and does not vest exclusive appointing authority either in the Secretary or the Chairman-Administrator.

§1111a. Administrative expenses; limitations

After June 30, 1939, the Federal Maritime Commission and the Secretary of Transportation shall not incur any obligations for administrative expenses except pursuant to an annual appropriation specifically therefor or to authority to use appropriations or other funds otherwise available therefor.

If the Secretary of the Navy certifies his approval under section 1151(b) of this Appendix, and the Secretary of Transportation approves the application, he may secure bids for the construction of the proposed vessel according to the approved plans and specifications.
If the bid of the shipbuilder who is the lowest responsible bidder is determined by the Secretary of Transportation to be fair and reasonable, the Secretary of Transportation may approve such bid, and if such approved bid is accepted by the proposed ship purchaser, the Secretary of Transportation is authorized to enter into a contract with the successful bidder for the construction, outfitting, and equipment of the proposed vessel, and for the payment by the Secretary of Transportation to the shipbuilder, on terms to be agreed upon in the contract, of the contract price of the vessel, out of the construction fund hereinbefore referred to, or out of other available funds.
Notwithstanding the provisions of the first sentence of section 1155 of this Appendix with respect to competitive bidding, the Secretary of Transportation is authorized to accept a price for the construction of the ship which has been negotiated between a shipyard and proposed ship purchaser if (1) the proposed ship purchaser and the shipyard submit backup cost details and evidence that the negotiated price is fair and reasonable; (2) the Secretary of Transportation finds that the negotiated price is fair and reasonable; and (3) the shipyard agrees that the Comptroller General of the United States or any of his duly authorized representatives shall, until the expiration of three years after final payment have access to and the right to examine any pertinent books, documents, papers, and records of the shipyard or any of its subcontractors related to the negotiation or performance of any contract or subcontract negotiated under this subsection and will include in its subcontracts a provision to that effect.
Concurrently with entering into such contract with the shipbuilder, the Secretary of Transportation is authorized to enter into a contract for the sale of such vessel upon its completion, to the applicant if he is the proposed ship purchaser and if not to another citizen of the United States, if the Secretary of Transportation determines that such citizen possesses the ability, experience, financial resources, and other qualifications necessary for the operation and maintenance of the vessel at a price corresponding to the estimated cost, as determined by the Secretary of Transportation pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, of building such vessel in a foreign shipyard.

The amount of reduction in selling price which is herein termed “construction differential subsidy” shall equal, but not exceed, the excess of the bid of the shipbuilder constructing the proposed vessel (excluding the cost of any features incorporated in the vessel for national defense uses, which shall be paid by the Secretary in addition to the subsidy), over the fair and reasonable estimate of cost, as determined by the Secretary, of the construction of that type vessel if it were constructed under similar plans and specifications (excluding national defense features as above provided) in a foreign shipbuilding center which is deemed by the Secretary to furnish a fair and representative example for the determination of the estimated foreign cost of construction of vessels of the type proposed to be constructed.
The Secretary of Transportation shall recompute such estimated foreign cost annually unless, in the opinion of the Secretary, there has been a significant change in shipbuilding market conditions.
The Secretary shall publish notice of his intention to compute or recompute such estimated foreign cost and shall give interested persons, including but not limited to shipyards and shipowners and associations thereof, an opportunity to file written statements.
The Secretary's consideration shall include, but not be limited to, all relevant matter so filed, and his determination shall include or be accompanied by a concise explanation of the basis of his determination.
The construction differential approved and paid by the Secretary shall not exceed 50 per centum of the cost of constructing, reconstructing, or reconditioning the vessel (excluding the cost of national defense features). If the Secretary finds that the construction differential exceeds, in any case, the foregoing percentage of such cost, the Secretary may negotiate with any bidder (whether or not such person is the lowest bidder) and may contract with such bidder (notwithstanding the first sentence of section 1155 of this Appendix) for the construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of the vessel involved in a domestic shipyard at a cost which will reduce the construction differential to such percentage or less.
In the event that the Secretary has reason to believe that the bidding in any instance is collusive, he shall report all of the evidence on which he acted (1) to the Attorney General of the United States, and (2) to the President of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House of Representatives if the Congress shall be in session or if the Congress shall not be in session, then to the Secretary of the Senate and Clerk of the House, respectively.

(c) Terms of sale of vessel to purchaser

In such contract of sale between the purchaser and the Secretary of Transportation, the purchaser shall be required to make cash payments to the Secretary of Transportation of not less than 25 per centum of the price at which the vessel is sold to the purchaser.
The cash payments shall be made at the time and in the same proportion as provided for the payments on account of the construction cost in the contract between the shipbuilder and the Secretary of Transportation.
The purchaser shall pay, not less frequently than annually, interest on those portions of the Secretary of Transportation's payments as made to the shipbuilder which are chargeable to the purchaser's portion of the price of the vessel (after deduction of the purchaser's cash payments) at a rate not less than (i) a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities of such loans, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum, plus (ii) an allowance adequate in the judgment of the Secretary of Transportation to cover administrative costs.
The balance of such purchase price shall be paid by the purchaser, within twenty-five years after delivery of the vessel and in not to exceed twenty-five equal annual installments, the first of which shall be payable one year after the delivery of the vessel by the Secretary of Transportation to the purchaser.
Interest at the rate per annum applicable to payments that are chargeable to the purchaser's portion of the price of the vessel shall be paid on all such installments of the purchase price remaining unpaid.

(d) Repealed.
Pub. L. 87–877, §2(a), Oct. 24, 1962, 76 Stat. 1200

(e) Construction in navy yards; sales to citizens; terms

If no bids are received for the construction, outfitting, or equipping of such vessel, or if it appears to the Secretary of Transportation that the bids received from privately owned shipyards of the United States are collusive, excessive, or unreasonable, and if a citizen of the United States agrees to purchase said vessel as provided in this section, then, to provide employment for citizens of the United States, the Secretary of Transportation may have such vessel constructed, outfitted, or equipped at not in excess of the actual cost thereof in a navy yard of the United States under such regulations as may be promulgated by the Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of Transportation.
In such event the Secretary of Transportation is authorized to pay for any such vessel so constructed from his construction fund.
The Secretary of Transportation is authorized to sell any vessel so constructed, outfitted, or equipped in a navy yard to a citizen of the United States for the fair and reasonable value thereof, but at not less than the cost thereof less the equivalent to the construction differential subsidy determined as provided by subsection (b) of this section, such sale to be in accordance with all the provisions of this subchapter.

(f) Survey of shipbuilding capability; correction of inadequacies; reimbursement of certain vessel construction and delivery expenses

The Secretary of Transportation, with the advice of and in coordination with the Secretary of the Navy, shall at least once each year, as required for purposes of this chapter, survey the existing privately owned shipyards capable of merchant ship construction, or review available data on such shipyards if deemed adequate, to determine whether their capabilities for merchant ship construction, including facilities and skilled personnel, provide an adequate mobilization base at strategic points for purposes of national defense and national emergency.
The Secretary of Transportation, in connection with ship construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or remodeling under this subchapter and subchapter VII of this chapter, upon a basis of a finding that the award of the proposed construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or remodeling work will remedy an existing or impending inadequacy in such mobilization base as to the capabilities and capacities of a shipyard or shipyards at a strategic point, and after taking into consideration the benefits accruing from standardized construction, the conditions of unemployment, and the needs and reasonable requirements of all shipyards, may allocate such construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or remodeling to such yard or yards in such manner as he may determine to be fair, just, and reasonable to all sections of the country, subject to the provisions of this subsection.
In the allocation of construction work to such yards as herein provided, the Secretary of Transportation may, after first obtaining competitive bids for such work in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, negotiate with the bidders and with other shipbuilders concerning the terms and conditions of any contract for such work, and is authorized to enter into such contract at a price deemed by the Secretary of Transportation to be fair and reasonable.
Any contract entered into by the Secretary of Transportation under the provisions of this subsection shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of this chapter, excepting those pertaining to the awarding of contracts to the lowest bidder which are inconsistent with the provisions of this subsection.
In the event that a contract is made providing for a price in excess of the lowest responsible bid which otherwise would be accepted, such excess shall be paid by the Secretary of Transportation as a part of the cost of national defense, and shall not be considered as a part of the construction-differential subsidy.
In the event that a contract is made providing for a price lower than the lowest responsible bid which otherwise would be accepted, the construction-differential subsidy shall be computed on the contract price in lieu of such bid.

If, as a result of allocation under this subsection, the purchaser incurs expenses for inspection and supervision of the vessel during construction and for the delivery voyage of the vessel in excess of the estimated expenses for the same services that he would have incurred if the vessel had been constructed by the lowest responsible bidder the Secretary of Transportation (with respect to construction under this subchapter, except section 1159 of this Appendix) shall reimburse the purchaser for such excess, less one-half of any gross income the purchaser receives that is allocable to the delivery voyage minus one-half of the extra expenses incurred to produce such gross income, and such reimbursement shall not be considered part of the construction-differential subsidy: Provided, That no interest shall be paid on any refund authorized under this chapter.
If the vessel is constructed under section 1159 of this Appendix the Secretary of Transportation shall reduce the price of the vessel by such excess, less one-half of any gross income (minus one-half of the extra expenses incurred to produce such gross income) the purchaser receives that is allocable to the delivery voyage.
In the case of a vessel that is not to receive operating-differential subsidy, the delivery voyage shall be deemed terminated at the port where the vessel begins loading.
In the case of a vessel that is to receive operating-differential subsidy, the delivery voyage shall be deemed terminated when the vessel begins loading at a United States port in an essential service.
In either case, however, the vessel owner shall not be compensated for excess vessel delivery costs in an amount greater than the expenses that would have been incurred in delivering the vessel from the shipyard at which it was built to the shipyard of the lowest responsible bidder.
If as a result of such allocation, the expenses the purchaser incurs with respect to such services are less than the expenses he would have incurred for such services if the vessel had been constructed by the lowest responsible bidder, the purchaser shall pay to the Secretary of Transportation an amount equal to such reduction and, if the vessel was built with the aid of construction-differential subsidy, such payment shall not be considered a reduction of the construction-differential subsidy.

(g) Sale of vessels acquired by Secretary

Upon the application of any citizen of the United States to purchase any vessel acquired by the Secretary of Transportation under the provisions of section 1125 of this Appendix, the Secretary of Transportation is authorized to sell such vessel to the applicant for the fair and reasonable value thereof, but at not less than the cost thereof to the Secretary of Transportation less depreciation at the rate of 4 per centum per annum from the date of completion, excluding the cost of national-defense features added by the Secretary of Transportation, less the equivalent of any applicable construction-differential subsidy as provided by subsection (b) of this section, such sale to be in accordance with all the provisions of this subchapter.
Such vessel shall thereupon be eligible for an operating-differential subsidy under subchapter VI of this chapter, notwithstanding the provisions of section 1171(a)(1), and section 1180(1) of this Appendix, or any other provision of law.

(h) Installation or removal of national defense features; title to such features

The Secretary of Transportation is authorized to construct, purchase, lease, acquire, store, maintain, sell, or otherwise dispose of national defense features intended for installation on vessels.
The Secretary of Transportation is authorized to install or remove such national defense features on any vessel (1) which is in the National Defense Reserve Fleet as defined by section 1744(a) of the Appendix to title 50, (2) which is requisitioned, purchased, or chartered under section 1242 of this Appendix, (3) which serves as security for the guarantee of an obligation by the Secretary of Transportation under subchapter XI of this chapter, or (4) which is the subject of an agreement between the owner of such vessel and the Secretary of Transportation to install or remove such national defense features.
Title to such national defense features which the Secretary of Transportation determines are not to be permanently incorporated in a vessel shall not be affected by such installation or removal unless otherwise transferred in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter.

(i) Plans, specifications, and proposals for national defense features; certification of approval

The Secretary of Transportation shall submit the plans and specifications for such national defense features and the proposals for their acquisition, storage, utilization, or disposition to the Navy Department for examination thereof and suggestion for such changes therein as may be deemed necessary or proper in order that such features shall be suitable for the use of the United States Government in time of war or national emergency.
If the Secretary of the Navy approves such plans, specifications, or proposals as submitted, or as modified in accordance with the provisions of this subsection, he shall certify such approval to the Secretary of Transportation.

Construction and Sale of Superliner Passenger Vessels

Pub. L. 85–521, July 15, 1958, 72 Stat. 359, provided: “That it is necessary, in order to carry out the merchant marine policy declared in the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended [this chapter], to have (a) a superliner passenger vessel equivalent to the steamship United States, to replace the steamship America for operation on an essential trade route in the North Atlantic, and (b) a superliner passenger vessel with capacity of approximately one thousand four hundred passengers for operation on an essential trade route in the Pacific Ocean.
Nothing herein shall preclude the operation of either of these vessels in other areas, subject to the approval of the Federal Maritime Board.
There is hereby authorized to be appropriated to the Department of Commerce such sums as may be necessary, to remain available until expended, for the construction, outfitting, and equipping of such vessels.

“Sec. 2. Concurrently with entering into contracts with shipbuilders for the construction of said vessels, the Board is authorized to enter into contracts for the sale of the vessels, fully outfitted and equipped, upon their completion, (a) with respect to the superliner passenger vessel equivalent to the steamship United States, to the United States Lines Company, for the fixed price of $47,000,000, and (b) with respect to the superliner passenger vessel for operation in the Pacific Ocean, to the American President Lines, Limited, for the fixed price of $34,000,000, or 45 per centum of the domestic construction cost of the vessel fully outfitted and equipped (excluding national defense features and escalation) whichever is the greater.
The sales prices stated herein shall include the cost of stabilizers, all outfit and equipment not covered by the shipbuilders’ bids, customary architects’ and interior decorators’ fees for design, inspection during construction, and all escalation provided for in the shipbuilders’ bids: Provided, however, That such prices shall be increased in an amount equal to 45 per centum of any net change in the cost of the vessels (other than national defense features) arising out of any changes in the bid specifications approved by the Federal Maritime Board or any changes in the usual outfitting and equipping of the vessels if such changes are requested by the purchasers and approved by the Federal Maritime Board after the enactment hereof.
Terms and conditions of payment of the purchase price shall be as provided for in sections 502(c) and 503 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended [sections 1152(c) and 1153 of this Appendix]. In order that such construction of the superliner passenger vessel equivalent to the steamship United States may be accomplished promptly, the Federal Maritime Board, in its discretion, may have such a vessel constructed, without further bidding, under outstanding bids which have hitherto been made by United States shipbuilders on a similar vessel.

“Sec. 3. Except as otherwise provided in this Act, the construction and sale of the superliner passenger vessels authorized by this Act shall be in accordance with the provisions of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended [this chapter].

“Sec. 4. For the purposes of this Act the words ‘construction differential subsidy’ used in the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended [this chapter], shall mean the difference between the sales price paid by the purchaser hereunder and the cost of the vessel (less national defense features) including the cost of stabilizers, all outfit and equipment not covered by the shipbuilders’ bids, customary architects’ and interior decorators’ fees for design, inspection during construction, and all escalation provided for in the shipbuilders’ bids.

“Sec. 5. Any contract for an operating differential subsidy on the operation of a vessel constructed and sold under this Act shall be subject to the provisions of title VI of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended [subchapter VI of this chapter]: Provided, however, That such contract shall provide that, if at the end of any recapture period, the net profits on the operation of such vessel for such recapture period, computed without regard to profits or losses on other vessels operated by the contractor, exceed 10 per centum per annum on a cumulative basis upon the contractor's capital necessarily employed in the operation of such vessel, as determined by the Federal Maritime Board, the contractor shall account to the United States for an amount equal to 75 per centum of such excess profits.”

§1153. Documentation of completed vessel under laws of United States; delivery to purchaser; first mortgage to secure deferred payments

Upon completion of the construction of any vessel in respect to which a construction-differential subsidy is to be allowed under this subchapter and its delivery by the shipbuilder to the Secretary of Transportation, the vessel shall be documented under the laws of the United States, and concurrently therewith, or as soon thereafter as practicable, the vessel shall be delivered with a bill of sale to the purchaser with warranty against liens, pursuant to the contract of sale between the purchaser and the Secretary of Transportation.
The vessel shall remain documented under the laws of the United States for not less than twenty-five years, or so long as there remains due the United States any principal or interest on account of the purchaser price, whichever is the longer period.
At the time of delivery of the vessel the purchaser shall execute and deliver a first-preferred mortgage to the United States to secure payment of any sums due from the purchaser in respect to said vessel: Provided, That notwithstanding any other provisions of law, the payment of any sums due in respect to a passenger vessel purchased under section 1737(b) 1 of the Appendix to title 50, reconverted or restored for normal operation in commercial services, or in respect to a passenger vessel purchased under subchapter V of this chapter, which is delivered subsequent to March 8, 1946, and which (i) is of not less than ten thousand gross tons, (ii) has a designed speed approved by the Secretary of Transportation but not less than eighteen knots, (iii) has accommodations for not less than two hundred passengers, and, (iv) is approved by the Secretary of Defense as being desirable for national defense purposes, may, with the approval of the Secretary of Transportation be secured only by a first-preferred mortgage on said vessel.
With the approval of the Secretary of Transportation, such preferred mortgage may provide that the sole recourse against the purchaser of such a passenger vessel under such mortgage, and any of the notes secured thereby, shall be limited to repossession of the vessel by the United States and the assignment of insurance claims, if the purchaser shall have complied with all provisions of the mortgage other than those relating to the payment of principal and interest when due, and the obligation of the purchaser shall be satisfied and discharged by the surrender of the vessel, and all right, title, and interest therein to the United States.
Such vessel upon surrender shall be (i) free and clear of all liens and encumbrances whatsoever, except the lien of the preferred mortgage, (ii) in class, and (iii) in as good order and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted, as when acquired by the purchaser, except that any deficiencies with respect to freedom from encumbrances, condition, and class, may, to the extent covered by valid policies of insurance, be satisfied by the assignment to the United States of claims of the purchaser under such policies of insurance.
The purchaser shall also comply with all the provisions of section 868 of this Appendix.

§1154. Purchase of vessel constructed in accordance with application for subsidy; bid or negotiated price basis for subsidy and payments for cost of national defense features; documentation

If a qualified purchaser under the terms of this subchapter desires to purchase a vessel to be constructed in accordance with an application for construction-differential subsidy under this subchapter, the Secretary of Transportation may, in lieu of contracting to pay the entire cost of the vessel under section 1152 of this Appendix, contract to pay only construction-differential subsidy and the cost of national defense features to the shipyard constructing such vessel.
The construction-differential subsidy and payments for the cost of national defense features shall be based upon the lowest responsible domestic bid unless the vessel is constructed at a negotiated price as provided by section 1152(a) of this Appendix or under a contract negotiated by the Secretary of Transportation as provided in section 1152(b) of this Appendix in which event the construction-differential subsidy and payments for the cost of national defense features shall be based upon such negotiated price.
No construction-differential subsidy, as provided in this section, shall be paid unless the said contract or contracts or other arrangements contain such provisions as are provided in this subchapter to protect the interests of the United States as the Secretary of Transportation deems necessary.
Such vessel shall be documented under the laws of the United States as provided in section 1153 of this Appendix.
The contract of sale, and the mortgage given to secure the payment of the unpaid balance of the purchase price, shall not restrict the lawful or proper use or operation of the vessel, except to the extent expressly required by law.

All construction in respect of which a construction-differential subsidy is allowed under this subchapter shall be performed in a shipyard of the United States as the result of competitive bidding, after due advertisement, with the right reserved in the Secretary of Transportation to disapprove, any or all bids.
In all such construction the shipbuilder, subcontractors, materialmen, or suppliers shall use, so far as practicable, only articles, materials, and supplies of the growth, production, or manufacture of the United States as defined in paragraph K 1 of section 1401 of title 19; Provided, however, That with respect to other than major components of the hull, superstructure, and any material used in the construction thereof, (1) if the Secretary of Transportation determines that the requirements of this sentence will unreasonably delay completion of any vessel beyond its contract delivery date, and (2) if such determination includes or is accompanied by a concise explanation of the basis therefor, then the Secretary of Transportation may waive such requirements to the extent necessary to prevent such delay.
No shipbuilder shall be deemed a responsible bidder unless he possesses the ability, experience, financial resources, equipment, and other qualifications necessary properly to perform the proposed contract.
Each bid submitted to the Secretary of Transportation shall be accompanied by all detailed estimates upon which it is based.
The Secretary of Transportation may require that the bids of any subcontractors, or other pertinent data, accompany such bid.
All such bids and data relating thereto shall be kept on file until disposed of as provided by law.
For the purposes of this subchapter V, the term “shipyard of the United States” means shipyards within any of the United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

§1156. Operation of subsidy constructed vessel limited to foreign trade; repayments to Secretary for deviations

Every owner of a vessel for which a construction-differential subsidy has been paid shall agree that the vessel shall be operated exclusively in foreign trade, or on a round-the-world voyage, or on a round voyage from the west coast of the United States to a European port or ports which includes intercoastal ports of the United States, or a round voyage from the Atlantic coast of the United States to the Orient which includes intercoastal ports of the United States, or on a voyage in foreign trade on which the vessel may stop at the State of Hawaii, or an island possession or island territory of the United States, and that if the vessel is operated in the domestic trade on any of the above-enumerated services, he will pay annually to the Secretary of Transportation that proportion of one-twenty-fifth of the construction-differential subsidy paid for such vessel as the gross revenue derived from the domestic trade bears to the gross revenue derived from the entire voyages completed during the preceding year.
The Secretary may consent in writing to the temporary transfer of such vessel to service other than the service covered by such agreement for periods not exceeding six months in any year, whenever the Secretary may determine that such transfer is necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter.
Such consent shall be conditioned upon the agreement by the owner to pay to the Secretary, upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, an amount which bears the same proportion to the construction-differential subsidy paid by the Secretary as such temporary period bears to the entire economic life of the vessel.
No operating-differential subsidy shall be paid for the operation of such vessel for such temporary period.

Any citizen of the United States may make application to the Secretary of Transportation for aid in the construction of a new vessel to be operated in the foreign or domestic trade (excepting vessels engaged solely in the transportation of property on inland rivers and canals exclusively). If such application is approved by the Secretary of Transportation, the vessel may be constructed under the terms and conditions of this subchapter, but no construction-differential subsidy shall be allowed.

§1160. Acquisition of obsolete vessels

(a) Definitions

When used in this section—

(1) The term “obsolete vessel” means a vessel or vessels, each of which (A) is of not less than one thousand three hundred and fifty gross tons, (B) in the judgment of the Secretary of Transportation, should, by reason of age, obsolescence, or otherwise, be replaced in the public interest and (C) has been owned by a citizen or citizens of the United States for at least three years immediately prior to the date of acquisition hereunder.

(2) The term “new vessel” means a vessel or vessels, each of which (A) is constructed under the provisions of this chapter, and is acquired within two years from the date of completion of such vessel, or is purchased under section 1204 of this Appendix, as amended, by the person turning in an obsolete vessel under this section, or (B) is hereafter constructed in a domestic shipyard on private account and not under the provisions of this chapter, and documented under the laws of the United States.

(b) Promotion of construction of new vessels; allowance on obsolete vessels

In order to promote the construction of new, safe, and efficient vessels to carry the domestic and foreign waterborne commerce of the United States, the Secretary of Transportation is authorized, subject to the provisions of this section, to acquire any obsolete vessel in exchange for an allowance of credit.
The obsolete vessel shall be acquired by the Secretary of Transportation, if the owner so requests, either at the time the owner contracts for the construction or purchase of a new vessel or within five days of the actual date of delivery of the new vessel to the owner.
The amount of the allowance shall be determined at the time of the acquisition of the obsolete vessel by the Secretary of Transportation.
In the event the obsolete vessel is acquired by the Secretary of Transportation at the time the owner contracts for the construction or purchase of the new vessel, the allowance shall not be paid to the owner of the obsolete vessel, but shall be applied upon the purchase price of a new vessel.
In the case of a new vessel constructed under the provisions of this chapter, such allowance may, under such terms and conditions as the Secretary of Transportation may prescribe, be applied upon the cash payments required under this chapter.
In case the new vessel is not constructed under the provisions of this chapter, the allowance shall, upon acquisition of the obsolete vessel by the Secretary of Transportation, be paid, for the account of the owner, to the shipbuilder constructing such new vessel.
In the event that title to the obsolete vessel is acquired by the Secretary of Transportation at the time of delivery of the new vessel, the allowance shall be deposited in the owner's capital construction fund.
This subsection shall apply to obsolete vessels exchanged for new vessels hereafter contracted to be built, or eligible for such exchange but not exchanged in connection with a contract for new vessels executed prior to October 1, 1960.

(c) Utility value of new vessel; gross tonnage

The utility value of the new vessel for operation in the domestic or foreign commerce of the United States shall not be substantially less than that of the obsolete vessel.
The gross tonnage of the obsolete vessel may exceed the gross tonnage of the new vessel in a ratio not in excess of three to one, if the Secretary of Transportation finds that the new vessel, although of lesser tonnage, will provide utility value equivalent to or greater than that of the obsolete vessel.

(d) Amount of allowance on obsolete vessel; determination of amount

The allowance for an obsolete vessel shall be the fair and reasonable value of such vessel as determined by the Secretary of Transportation.
In making such determination the Secretary of Transportation shall consider: (1) the scrap value of the obsolete vessel both in American and foreign markets, (2) the depreciated value based on a twenty or twenty-five year life, whichever is applicable to the obsolete vessel, and (3) the market value thereof for operation in the world trade or in the foreign or domestic trade of the United States.
In the event the obsolete vessel is acquired by the Secretary of Transportation at the time the owner contracts for the construction of the new vessel, and the owner uses such vessel during the period of construction of the new vessel, the allowance shall be reduced by an amount representing the fair value of such use.
The rate for the use of the obsolete vessel shall be fixed by the Secretary of Transportation for the entire period of such use at the time of execution of the contract for the construction of the new vessel.

(e) Recognition of gain for income tax purposes; basis for gain or loss

No gain shall be recognized to the owner for the purpose of Federal income taxes in the case of a transfer of an obsolete vessel to the Secretary of Transportation under the provisions of this section.
The basis for gain or loss upon a sale or exchange and for depreciation under the applicable Federal income-tax laws of a new vessel acquired as contemplated in this section shall be the same as the basis of the obsolete vessel or vessels exchanged for credit upon the acquisition of such new vessel, increased in the amount of the cost of such vessel (other than the cost represented by such obsolete vessel or vessels) and decreased in the amount of loss recognized upon such transfer.

(f) Report to Congress

The Secretary of Transportation shall include in his annual report to Congress a detailed statement of all transactions consummated under the provisions of the preceding subsections during the period covered by such report.

(g) Use of vessels 25 years old or more

An obsolete vessel acquired by the Secretary of Transportation under this section which is or becomes twenty-five years old or more, and vessels presently in the Secretary's laid-up fleet which are or become twenty-five years old or more, shall in no case be used for commercial operation, except that any such obsolete vessel, or any such vessel in the laid-up fleet may be used during any period in which vessels may be requisitioned under section 1242 of this Appendix, as amended, and except as otherwise provided in this chapter for the employment of the Secretary's vessels in steamship lines on trade routes exclusively serving the foreign trade of the United States.

(h) Repealed.
Pub. L. 101–225, title III, §307(7), Dec. 12, 1989, 103 Stat. 1925

(i) Exchange of vessels; valuation; scrapping of traded out vessels

The Secretary of Transportation is authorized to acquire suitable documented vessels, as defined in section 2101 of title 46, with funds in the Vessel Operations Revolving Fund derived from the sale of obsolete vessels in the National Defense Reserve Fleet.
For purposes of this subsection, the acquired and obsolete vessels shall be valued at their scrap value in domestic or foreign markets as of the date of the acquisition for or sale from the National Defense Reserve Fleet; except that, in a transaction subject to this section, the value assigned to those vessels will be determined on the same basis, with consideration given to the fair value of the cost of positioning the traded-out vessel to the place of scrapping.
All costs incident to the lay-up of the vessel acquired under this subsection may be paid from balances in the Fund.
Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 808 and 835 of this Appendix, vessels sold from the National Defense Reserve Fleet under this subsection may be scrapped in approved foreign markets.

(j) Placement in national defense reserve fleet of acquired vessels

Any vessel heretofore or hereafter acquired under this section, or otherwise acquired by the Maritime Administration of the Department of Transportation under any other authority shall be placed in the national defense reserve fleet established under authority of section 11 of the Merchant Ship Sales Act of 1946 [50 App. U.S.C. 1744] and shall not be traded out or sold from such reserve fleet, except as provided for in subsections (g) and (i) of this section.
This limitation shall not affect the rights of the Secretary of Transportation to dispose of a vessel as provided in other sections of this subchapter or in subchapters VII or XI of this chapter.

§1161. Reserve funds for construction or acquisition of vessels; taxation

(a) “New vessel” defined

When used in this section the term “new vessel” means any vessel (1) documented or agreed with the Secretary of Transportation to be documented under the laws of the United States; (2) construction in the United States after December 31, 1939, or the construction of which has been financed under subchapters V or VII of this chapter, or the construction of which has been aided by a mortgage insured under subchapter XI of this chapter; and (3) either (A) of such type, size, and speed as the Secretary of Transportation shall determine to be suitable for use on the high seas or Great Lakes in carrying out the purposes of this chapter, but not of less than two thousand gross tons or of less speed than twelve knots, unless the Secretary of Transportation shall determine and certify in each case that a vessel of a specified lesser tonnage or speed is desirable for use by the United States in case of war or national emergency, or (B) constructed to replace a vessel or vessels requisitioned or purchased by the United States.

(b) Establishment of construction reserve funds

For the purposes of promoting the construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or acquisition of vessels, or for other purposes authorized in this section, necessary to carrying out the policy set forth in section 1101 of this Appendix, any citizen of the United States who is operating a vessel or vessels in the foreign or domestic commerce of the United States or in the fisheries or owns in whole or in part a vessel or vessels being so operated, or who, at the time of purchase or requisition of the vessel by the Government, was operating a vessel or vessels so engaged or owned in whole or in part a vessel or vessels being so operated or had acquired or was having constructed a vessel or vessels for the purpose of operation in such commerce or in the fisheries, may establish a construction reserve fund, for the construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or acquisition of new vessels, or for other purposes authorized in this section, to be composed of deposits of proceeds from sales of vessels, indemnities on account of losses of vessels, earnings from the operation of vessels documented under the laws of the United States and from services incident thereto, and receipts, in the form of interest or otherwise, with respect to amounts previously deposited.
Such construction reserve fund shall be established, maintained, expended, and used in accordance with the provisions of this section and rules or regulations to be prescribed jointly by the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of the Treasury.

(c) Recognition of gain for taxation where proceeds of sale or indemnity for loss deposited in fund

In the case of the sale or actual or constructive total loss of a vessel, if the taxpayer deposits an amount equal to the net proceeds of the sale or to the net indemnity with respect to the loss in a construction reserve fund established under subsection (b) of this section, then—

(1) if the taxpayer so elects in his income-tax return for the taxable year in which the gain was realized, or

(2) in case a vessel is purchased or requisitioned by the United States, or is lost, in any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1939, and the taxpayer receives payment for the vessel so purchased or requisitioned, or receives from the United States indemnity on account of such loss, subsequent to the end of such taxable year, if the taxpayer so elects prior to the expiration of sixty days after the receipt of the payment or indemnity, and in accordance with a form of election to be prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury,

no gain shall be recognized to the taxpayer in respect of such sale or indemnification in the computation of net income for the purposes of Federal income or excess-profits taxes.
If an election is made under subdivision (2) of this subsection and if computation or recomputation in accordance with this subsection is otherwise allowable but is prevented, on the date of making such election or within six months thereafter, by any statute of limitation, such computation or recomputation nevertheless shall be made notwithstanding such statute if a claim therefor is filed within six months after the date of making such election.

For the purposes of this subsection no amount shall be considered as deposited in a construction reserve fund unless it is deposited within sixty days after it is received by the taxpayer.

As used in this subsection the term “net proceeds” and the term “net indemnity” mean the sum of (1) the adjusted basis of the vessel and (2) the amount of gain which would be recognized to the taxpayer without regard to this subsection.

(d) Basis for determining gain or loss and for depreciation of new vessels

The basis for determining gain or loss and for depreciation, for the purposes of Federal income or excess profits taxes, of any new vessel constructed, reconstructed, reconditioned, or acquired by the taxpayer, or with respect to which purchase-money indebtedness is liquidated as provided in subsection (g) of this section, in whole or in part out of the construction reserve fund shall be reduced by that portion of the deposits in the fund expended in the construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, acquisition, or liquidation of purchase-money indebtedness of the new vessel which represents gain not recognized for tax purposes under subsection (c) of this section.

(e) Order, proportions, etc., of deposits and withdrawals

For the purposes of this section, (1) if the net proceeds of a sale or the net indemnity in respect of a loss are deposited in more than one deposit, the amount consisting of the gain shall be considered as first deposited; (2) amounts expended, obligated, or otherwise withdrawn shall be applied against the amounts deposited in the fund in the order of deposit; and (3) if any deposit consists in part of gain not recognized under subsection (c) of this section, any expenditure, obligation, or withdrawal applied against such deposit shall be considered to consist of gain in the proportion that the part of the deposit consisting of gain bears to the total amount of the deposit.

(f) Amounts in fund as accumulation of earnings or profits

With respect to any taxable year, amounts on deposit on the last day of such year in a construction reserve fund in accordance with this section and with respect to which all the requirements of subsection (g) of this section have been satisfied, to the extent that such requirements are applicable as of the last day of said taxable year, shall not constitute an accumulation of earnings or profits within the meaning of section 102 of the Internal Revenue Code.

(g) Benefits of section conditioned upon manner and time of expenditure of deposits

The provisions of subsections (c) and (f) of this section shall apply to any deposit in the construction reserve fund only to the extent that such deposit is expended or obligated for expenditure, in accordance with rules and regulations to be prescribed jointly by the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of the Treasury—

(1) under a contract for the construction or acquisition of a new vessel or vessels (or in the discretion of the Secretary of Transportation, for a part interest therein), or, with the approval of the Secretary of Transportation, for the reconstruction or reconditioning of a new vessel or vessels, entered into within (i) two years from the date of deposit or the date of any extension thereof which may be granted by the Secretary of Transportation pursuant to the provisions of subsection (h) of this section, in the case of deposits made prior to the date on which these amendatory provisions become effective, or (ii) three years from the date of such deposit in the case of a deposit made after such effective date, only if under such rules and regulations—

(A) within such period not less than 121/2 per centum of the construction or contract price of the vessel or vessels is paid or irrevocably committed on account thereof and the plans and specifications therefor are approved by the Secretary of Transportation to the extent by him deemed necessary; and

(B) in case of a vessel or vessels not constructed under the provisions of this subchapter or not purchased from the Secretary of Transportation, (i) said construction is completed, within six months from the date of the construction contract, to the extent of not less than 5 per centum thereof (or in case the contract covers more than one vessel, the construction of the first vessel so contracted for is so completed to the extent of not less than 5 per centum) as estimated by the Secretary of Transportation and certified by him to the Secretary of the Treasury, and (ii) all construction under such contract is completed with reasonable dispatch thereafter;

(2) for the liquidation of existing or subsequently incurred purchase-money indebtedness to persons other than a parent company of, or a company affiliated or associated with, the mortgagor on a new vessel or vessels within (i) two years from the date of deposit or the date of any extension thereof which may be granted by the Secretary of Transportation pursuant to the provisions of subsection (h) of this section, in the case of deposits made prior to the date on which these amendatory provisions become effective, or (ii) three years from the date of such deposit in the case of a deposit made after such effective date.

The Secretary of Transportation is authorized under rules and regulations to be prescribed jointly by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Transportation to grant extensions of the period within which the deposits shall be expended or obligated or within which construction shall have progressed to the extent of 5 per centum of completion as provided herein, but such extension shall not be for an aggregate additional period in excess of two years with respect to the expenditure or obligation of such deposits or more than one year with respect to the progress of such construction: Provided, That until January 1, 1965, in addition to the extensions hereinbefore permitted, further extensions may be granted ending not later than December 31, 1965.

(i) Taxation of deposits upon failure of conditions

Any such deposited gain or portion thereof which is not so expended or obligated within the period provided, or which is otherwise withdrawn before the expiration of such period, or with respect to which the construction has not progressed to the extent of 5 per centum of completion within the period provided, or with respect to which the Secretary of Transportation finds and certifies to the Secretary of the Treasury that, for causes within the control of the taxpayer, the entire construction is not completed with reasonable dispatch, if otherwise taxable income under the law applicable to the taxable year in which such gain was realized, shall be included in the gross income for such taxable year, except for the purpose of the declared value excess-profits tax and the capital stock tax.
If any such deposited gain or portion thereof with respect to a deposit made in any taxable year ending on or before June 30, 1945 is so included in gross income for such taxable year, there shall (in addition to any other deficiency) be assessed, collected, and paid in the same manner as if it were a deficiency, an amount equal to 1.1 per centum of the amount of gain so included, such amount being in lieu of any adjustment with respect to the declared value excess-profits tax for such taxable year.

(j) Assessment and collection of deficiency tax

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any deficiency in tax for any taxable year resulting from the inclusion of any amount in gross income as provided by subsection (i) of this section, and the amount to be treated as a deficiency under such subsection in lieu of any adjustment with respect to the declared value excess-profits tax, may be assessed or a proceeding in court for the collection thereof may be begun without assessment, at any time: Provided, however, That interest on any such deficiency or amount to be treated as a deficiency shall not begin until the date the deposited gain or portion thereof in question is required under subsection (i) of this section to be included in gross income.

(k) Taxable years governed by section

This section shall be applicable to a taxpayer only in respect of sales or indemnifications for losses occurring within a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1939, and only in respect of earnings derived during a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1939.

(l) Vessels deemed constructed or acquired by taxpayers owning stock in corporations constructing or acquiring vessels

For the purposes of this section a vessel shall be considered as constructed or acquired by the taxpayer if constructed or acquired by a corporation at a time when the taxpayer owns at least 95 per centum of the total number of shares of each class of stock of the corporation.

(m) Definitions

The terms used in this section shall have the same meaning as in chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code.

(n) “Contract for the construction” and “construction contract” defined

SUBCHAPTER VI—VESSEL OPERATING ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS

Subchapter Referred to in Other Sections

This subchapter is referred to in sections 1131, 1152, 1191, 1204, 1211, 1222, 1226, 1227, 1228, 1244 of this Appendix.

Part A—Operating-Differential Subsidy Program

Part Referred to in Other Sections

This part is referred to in sections 808, 1187a, 1222, 1223 of this Appendix.

§1171. Subsidy authorized for operation of vessels in foreign trade or in off-season cruises

(a) Application for subsidy; conditions precedent to granting

The Secretary of Transportation is authorized and directed to consider the application of any citizen of the United States for financial aid in the operation of a vessel or vessels, which are to be used in an essential service in the foreign commerce of the United States or in such service and in cruises authorized under section 1183 of this Appendix.
In this subchapter VI the term “essential service” means the operation of a vessel on a service, route, or line described in section 1121(a) of this Appendix or in bulk cargo carrying service described in section 1121(b) of this Appendix.
No such application shall be approved by the Secretary of Transportation unless he determines that (1) the operation of such vessel or vessels in an essential service is required to meet foreign-flag competition and to promote the foreign commerce of the United States except to the extent such vessels are to be operated on cruises authorized under section 1183 of this Appendix, and that such vessel or vessels were built in the United States, or have been documented under the laws of the United States not later than February 1, 1928, or actually ordered and under construction for the account of citizens of the United States prior to such date; (2) the applicant owns, or leases or can and will build or purchase, or lease, a vessel or vessels of the size, type, speed, and number, and with the proper equipment required to enable him to operate in an essential service, in such manner as may be necessary to meet competitive conditions, and to promote foreign commerce; (3) the applicant possesses the ability, experience, financial resources, and other qualifications necessary to enable him to conduct the proposed operations of the vessel or vessels as to meet competitive conditions and promote foreign commerce; (4) the granting of the aid applied for is necessary to place the proposed operations of the vessel or vessels on a parity with those of foreign competitors, and is reasonably calculated to carry out effectively the purposes and policy of this chapter.
To the extent the application covers cruises, as authorized under section 1183 of this Appendix, the Secretary of Transportation may make the portion of this last determination relating to parity on the basis that any foreign flag cruise from the United States competes with any American flag cruise from the United States.

(b) Statements as to financial interests to accompany application; penalty for false statements

Every application for an operating-differential subsidy under the provisions of this subchapter shall be accompanied by statements disclosing the names of all persons having any pecuniary interest, direct or indirect, in such application, or in the ownership or use of the vessel or vessels, routes, or lines covered thereby, and the nature and extent of any such interest, together with such financial and other statements as may be required by the Secretary of Transportation.
All such statements shall be under oath or affirmation and in such form as the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe.
Any person who, in an application for financial aid under this subchapter or in any statement required to be filed therewith, willfully makes any untrue statement of a material fact, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

Section Referred to in Other Sections

This section is referred to in sections 1152, 1185a of this Appendix.

§1172. Determination of necessity of subsidy to meet competition

Except with respect to cruises authorized under section 1183 of this Appendix, no contract for an operating-differential subsidy shall be made by the Secretary of Transportation for the operation of a vessel or vessels to meet foreign competition, except direct foreign-flag competition, until and unless the Secretary of Transportation, after a full and complete investigation and hearing, shall determine that an operating-differential subsidy is necessary to meet competition of foreign-flag ships.

(June 29, 1936, ch. 858, title VI, §602, 49 Stat. 2002; June 23, 1938, ch. 600, §40(b), 52 Stat. 964; Pub. L. 87–45, §3, May 27, 1961, 75 Stat. 91; Pub. L. 91–469, §35(a), Oct. 21, 1970, 84 Stat. 1035; Pub. L. 97–31, §12(94), Aug. 6, 1981, 95 Stat. 161.)

§1173. Contracts for payment of subsidy

(a) Authorization of contracts

If the Secretary of Transportation approves the application, he may enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of an operating-differential subsidy determined in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, for the operation of such vessel or vessels in an essential service and in cruises authorized under section 1183 of this Appendix for a period not exceeding twenty years, and subject to such reasonable terms and conditions, consistent with this chapter, as the Secretary of Transportation shall require to effectuate the purposes and policy of this chapter, including a performance bond with approved sureties, if such bond is required by the Secretary of Transportation.

(b) Amount of subsidy

Such contract shall provide, except as the parties should agree upon a lesser amount, that the amount of the operating-differential subsidy for the operation of vessels in an essential service shall equal the excess of the subsidizable wage costs of the United States officers and crews, the fair and reasonable cost of insurance, subsistence of officers and crews on passenger vessels, as defined in section 1183 of this Appendix, maintenance, and repairs not compensated by insurance, incurred in the operation under United States registry of the vessel or vessels covered by the contract, over the estimated fair and reasonable cost of the same items of expense (after deducting therefrom any estimated increase in such items necessitated by features incorporated pursuant to the provisions of section 1151(b) of this Appendix) if such vessel or vessels were operated under the registry of a foreign country whose vessels are substantial competitors of the vessel or vessels covered by the contract: Provided, however, That the Secretary of Transportation may, with respect to any vessel in an essential bulk cargo carrying service as described in section 1121(b) of this Appendix, pay, in lieu of the operating-differential subsidy provided by this subsection (b), such sums as he shall determine to be necessary to make the cost of operating such vessel competitive with the cost of operating similar vessels under the registry of a foreign country.
For any period during which a vessel cruises as authorized by section 1183 of this Appendix, operating-differential subsidy shall be computed as though the vessel were operating on the essential service to which the vessel is assigned: Provided, however, That if the cruise vessel calls at a port or ports outside of its assigned service, but which is served with passenger vessels (as defined in section 1183 of this Appendix) by another subsidized operator at an operating-differential subsidy rate for wages lower than the cruise vessel has on its assigned essential service, the operating-differential subsidy rates for each of the subsidizable items for each day (a fraction of a day to count as a day) that the vessel stops at such port shall be at the respective rates applicable to the subsidized operator regularly serving the area.

(c) “Collective bargaining costs”, “base period costs”, “base period”, and “subsidizable wage costs of United States officers and crews” defined; determination of collective bargaining costs and establishment of new base periods; wage change index

(1) When used in this section—

(A) The term “collective bargaining costs” means the annual cost, calculated on the basis of the per diem rate of expense as of any date, of all items of expense required of the applicant through collective bargaining or other agreement, covering the employ of United States officers and crew of a vessel, including payments required by law to assure old-age pensions, unemployment benefits, or similar benefits and taxes or other governmental assessments on crew payrolls, but excluding subsistence of officers and crews on vessels other than passenger vessels as defined in section 1183 of this Appendix and costs relating to:

(i) the officers or members of the crew that the Secretary of Transportation has found, prior to the award of a contract for the construction or reconstruction of a vessel, to be unnecessary for the efficient and economical operation of such vessel: Provided, That the Secretary of Transportation shall afford representatives of the collective-bargaining unit or units responsible for the manning of the vessel an opportunity to comment on such finding prior to the effective date of such finding: And provided further, That in determining whether officers or members of the crew are necessary for the efficient and economical operation of such vessel, the Secretary of Transportation shall give due consideration to, but shall not be bound by, wage and manning scales and working conditions required by a bona fide collective-bargaining agreement, or

(ii) those officers or members of the crew that the Secretary of Transportation has found, prior to ninety days following October 21, 1970, to be unnecessary for the efficient and economical operation of the vessel.

(B) The term “base period costs” means for the base period beginning July 1, 1970, and ending June 30, 1971, the collective-bargaining costs as of January 1, 1971, less all other items of cost that have been disallowed by the Secretary of Transportation prior to ninety days following October 21, 1970, and not already excluded from collective-bargaining costs under subparagraph (A)(i) or (A)(ii) of this subsection.
In any subsequent base period the term “base period costs” means the average of the subsidizable wage cost of United States officers and crews for the preceding annual period ending June 30 (calculated without regard to the limitation of the last sentence of paragraph (D) of this subdivision but increased or decreased by the increase or decrease in the index described in subdivision (3) of this subsection from January 1 of such annual period to January 1 of the base period), and the collective-bargaining costs as of January 1 of the base period: Provided, That in no event shall the base period cost be such that the difference between the base period cost and the collective-bargaining costs as of January 1 of any base period subsequent to the first base period exceeds five-fourths of 1 per centum of the collective-bargaining costs as of such January 1 multiplied by the number of years that have elapsed since the most recent base period.

(C) The term “base period” means any annual period beginning July 1, and ending June 30 with respect to which a base period cost is established.

(D) The term “subsidizable wage costs of United States officers and crews” in any period other than a base period means the most recent base period costs increased or decreased by the increase or decrease from January 1 of such base period to January 1 of such period in the index described in subdivision (3) hereof, and with respect to a base period means the base period cost.
The subsidizable wage costs of United States officers and crews in any period other than a base period shall not be less than 90 per centum of the collective-bargaining costs as of January 1 of such period nor greater than 110 per centum of such collective-bargaining costs.

(2) The Secretary of Transportation shall determine the collective-bargaining costs on ships in subsidized operation as of January 1, 1971, and as of each January 1 thereafter, and shall as of intervals of not less than two years nor more than four years, establish a new base period cost, except that the Secretary shall not establish a new base period unless he announces his intention to do so prior to the December 31 that would be included in the new base period.

(3) The Bureau of Labor Statistics shall compile the index referred to in subdivision (1). Such index shall consist of the average annual change in wages and benefits placed into effect for employees covered by collective-bargaining agreements with equal weight to be given to changes affecting employees in the transportation industry (excluding the offshore maritime industry) and to changes affecting employees in private nonagricultural industries other than transportation.
Such index shall be based on the materials regularly used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in compiling its regularly published statistical series on wage and benefit changes arrived at through collective bargaining.
Such materials shall remain confidential and not be subject to disclosure.

(d) Foreign wage computation; foreign manning

Each foreign wage cost computation shall be made after an opportunity is given to the contractor to submit in writing and in timely fashion all relevant data within his possession.
In making the computation, the Secretary shall consider all relevant matter so presented and all foreign wage cost data collected at his request or on his behalf.
Such foreign cost data shall be made available to an interested contractor, unless the Secretary shall find that disclosure of the data will prevent him from obtaining such data in the future.
In determining foreign manning for purposes of this section, the foreign manning determined for any ship type with respect to any base period shall not be redetermined until the beginning of a new base period.

(e) Monthly payment of wage subsidy; procedures for calculation and payment of subsidy on certain expenses

The wage subsidy shall be payable monthly for the voyages completed during the month, upon the contractor's certification that the subsidized vessels were in authorized service during the month.
The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe procedures for the calculation and payment of subsidy on items of expense which are included in “collective-bargaining costs” but are not included in the daily rate because they are unpredictably timed.

(f) Monthly percentage payment of other than wage subsidy; security for refund of overpayments; payment of remainder after audit of voyage accounts

Ninety percent of the amount of the insurance and maintenance and repair and subsistence of officers and crews subsidy shall be payable monthly for the voyages completed during the month on the basis of the subsidy estimated to have accrued with respect to such voyages.
Any such payment shall be made only after there has been furnished to the Secretary of Transportation such security as he deems to be reasonable and necessary to assure refund of any overpayment.
The contractor and the Secretary of Transportation shall audit the voyage accounts as soon as practicable after such payment.
The remaining 10 percent of such subsidy shall be payable after such audit.

This section is referred to in sections 1183, 1185a of this Appendix.

§1174. Additional subsidy; when authorized

If in the case of any particular foreign-trade route the Secretary of Transportation shall find after consultation with the Secretary of State, that the subsidy provided for in this subchapter is in any respect inadequate to offset the effect of governmental aid paid to foreign competitors, he may grant such additional subsidy as he determines to be necessary for that purpose.

(June 29, 1936, ch. 858, title VI, §604, 49 Stat. 2003; June 23, 1938, ch. 600, §21, 52 Stat. 959; Aug. 4, 1939, ch. 417, §9, 53 Stat. 1185; Pub. L. 97–31, §12(95), Aug. 6, 1981, 95 Stat. 162.)

§1175. Vessels excluded from subsidy

(a) Vessels engaged in coastwise or intercoastal trade; vessels on inland waterways

No operating-differential subsidy shall be paid for the operation of any vessel on a voyage on which it engages in coastwise or intercoastal trade: Provided, however, That such subsidy may be paid on a round-the-world voyage or a round voyage from the west coast of the United States to a European port or ports or a round voyage from the Atlantic coast to the Orient which includes intercoastal ports of the United States or a voyage in foreign trade on which the vessel may stop at the State of Hawaii, or an island possession or island territory of the United States, and if the subsidized vessel earns any gross revenue on the carriage of mail, passengers, or cargo by reason of such coastal or intercoastal trade the subsidy payment for the entire voyage shall be reduced by an amount which bears the same ratio to the subsidy otherwise payable as such gross revenue bears to the gross revenue derived from the entire voyage.
No vessel operating on the inland waterways of the United States shall be considered for the purposes of this chapter to be operating in foreign trade.

(b) Vessels more than 25 years old

No operating-differential subsidy shall be paid for the operation of a vessel after the calendar year the vessel becomes 25 years of age, unless the Secretary of Transportation has determined, before October 8, 1996, that it is in the public interest to grant such financial aid for the operation of such vessel.

(c) Vessels to be operated in an essential service served by citizens of United States

No contract shall be made under this subchapter with respect to a vessel to be operated in an essential service served by citizens of the United States which would be in addition to the existing service, or services, unless the Secretary of Transportation shall determine after proper hearing of all parties that the service already provided by vessels of United States registry is inadequate, and that in the accomplishment of the purposes and policy of this chapter additional vessels should be operated thereon; and no contract shall be made with respect to a vessel operated or to be operated in an essential service served by two or more citizens of the United States with vessels of United States registry, if the Secretary of Transportation shall determine the effect of such a contract would be to give undue advantage or be unduly prejudicial, as between citizens of the United States, in the operation of vessels in such essential service unless following public hearing, due notice of which shall be given to each operator serving such essential service, the Secretary of Transportation shall find that it is necessary to enter into such contract in order to provide adequate service by vessels of United States registry.
The Secretary of Transportation in determining for the purposes of this section whether services are competitive, shall take into consideration the type, size, and speed of the vessels employed, whether passenger or cargo, or combination passenger and cargo, vessels, the ports or ranges between which they run, the character of cargo carried, and such other facts as he may deem proper.

§1176. Readjustments; change in service; withdrawal from service; payment of excess profits; wages, etc.; American materials

Every contract for an operating-differential subsidy under this subchapter shall provide (1) that the amount of the future payments to the contractor shall be subject to review and readjustment from time to time, but not more frequently than once a year, at the instance of the Secretary of Transportation or of the contractor.
If any such readjustment cannot be reached by mutual agreement, the Secretary of Transportation, on his own motion or on the application of the contractor, shall, after a proper hearing, determine the facts and make such readjustment in the amount of such future payments as he may determine to be fair and reasonable and in the public interest.
The testimony in every such proceeding shall be reduced to writing and filed in the office of the Secretary of Transportation.
His decision shall be based upon and governed by the changes which may have occurred since the date of the said contract, with respect to the items theretofore considered and on which such contract was based, and other conditions affecting shipping, and shall be promulgated in a formal order, which shall be accompanied by a report in writing in which the Secretary of Transportation shall state his findings of fact; (2) that the compensation to be paid under it shall be reduced, under such terms and in such amounts as the Secretary of Transportation shall determine, for any periods in which the vessel or vessels are laid up; (3) that if the Secretary of Transportation shall determine that a change in an essential service, which is receiving an operating-differential subsidy under this subchapter, is necessary in the accomplishment of the purposes of this chapter, it may make such change upon such readjustment of payments to the contractor as shall be arrived at by the method prescribed in clause (1) of these conditions; (4) that if at any time the contractor receiving an operating-differential subsidy claims that he cannot maintain and operate his vessels in such an essential service, with a reasonable profit upon his investment, and applies to the Secretary of Transportation for a modification or rescission of his contract to maintain such essential service, and the Secretary of Transportation determines that such claim is proved the Secretary of Transportation shall modify or rescind such contract and permit the contractor to withdraw such vessels from such essential service upon a date fixed by the Secretary of Transportation, and upon the date of such withdrawal the further payment of the operating differential subsidy shall cease and the contractor be discharged from any further obligation under such contract; (5) that the contractor shall conduct his operations with respect to essential services and any services authorized under section 1183 of this Appendix, covered by his contract in an economical and efficient manner, and (6) that whenever practicable, an operator who receives subsidy with respect to subsistence of officers and crews shall use as such subsistence items only articles, materials, and supplies of the growth, production, and manufacture of the United States, as defined in section 1155 of this Appendix, except when it is necessary to purchase supplies outside the United States to enable such vessel to continue and complete her voyage, and an operator who receives subsidy with respect to repairs shall perform such repairs within any of the United States or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, except in an emergency.

§1177. Capital construction fund

(a) Agreement rules; persons eligible; replacement, additional, or reconstructed vessels for prescribed trade and fishery operations; amount of deposits, annual limitation; conditions and requirements for deposits and withdrawals

Any citizen of the United States owning or leasing one or more eligible vessels (as defined in subsection (k)(1) of this section) may enter into an agreement with the Secretary under, and as provided in, this section to establish a capital construction fund (hereinafter in this section referred to as the “fund”) with respect to any or all of such vessels.
Any agreement entered into under this section shall be for the purpose of providing replacement vessels, additional vessels, or reconstructed vessels, built in the United States and documented under the laws of the United States for operation in the United States foreign, Great Lakes, or noncontiguous domestic trade or in the fisheries of the United States and shall provide for the deposit in the fund of the amounts agreed upon as necessary or appropriate to provide for qualified withdrawals under subsection (f) of this section.
The deposits in the fund, and all withdrawals from the fund, whether qualified or nonqualified, shall be subject to such conditions and requirements as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe or are set forth in such agreement; except that the Secretary may not require any person to deposit in the fund for any taxable year more than 50 percent of that portion of such person's taxable income for such year (computed in the manner provided in subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section) which is attributable to the operation of the agreement vessels.

(b) Ceiling on deposits; lessees; “agreement vessel” defined

(1) The amount deposited under subsection (a) of this section in the fund for any taxable year shall not exceed the sum of:

(A) that portion of the taxable income of the owner or lessee for such year (computed as provided in chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.] but without regard to the carryback of any net operating loss or net capital loss and without regard to this section) which is attributable to the operation of the agreement vessels in the foreign or domestic commerce of the United States or in the fisheries of the United States,

(B) the amount allowable as a deduction under section 167 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [26 U.S.C. 167] for such year with respect to the agreement vessels,

(C) if the transaction is not taken into account for purposes of subparagraph (A), the net proceeds (as defined in joint regulations) from (i) the sale or other disposition of any agreement vessel, or (ii) insurance or indemnity attributable to any agreement vessel, and

(D) the receipts from the investment or reinvestment of amounts held in such fund.

(2) In the case of a lessee, the maximum amount which may be deposited with respect to an agreement vessel by reason of paragraph (1)(B) for any period shall be reduced by any amount which, under an agreement entered into under this section, the owner is required or permitted to deposit for such period with respect to such vessel by reason of paragraph (1)(B).

(3) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term “agreement vessel” includes barges and containers which are part of the complement of such vessel and which are provided for in the agreement.

(c) Investment requirements; depositories; fiduciary requirements; interest-bearing securities; stock: percentage for domestic issues, listing and registration, prudent acquisitions, value and percentage equilibrium, and treatment of preferred issues

Amounts in any fund established under this section shall be kept in the depository or depositories specified in the agreement and shall be subject to such trustee and other fiduciary requirements as may be specified by the Secretary.
They may be invested only in interest-bearing securities approved by the Secretary; except that, if the Secretary consents thereto, an agreed percentage (not in excess of 60 percent) of the assets of the fund may be invested in the stock of domestic corporations.
Such stock must be currently fully listed and registered on an exchange registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a national securities exchange, and must be stock which would be acquired by prudent men of discretion and intelligence in such matters who are seeking a reasonable income and the preservation of their capital.
If at any time the fair market value of the stock in the fund is more than the agreed percentage of the assets in the fund, any subsequent investment of amounts deposited in the fund, and any subsequent withdrawal from the fund, shall be made in such a way as to tend to restore the fund to a situation in which the fair market value of the stock does not exceed such agreed percentage.
For purposes of this subsection, if the common stock of a corporation meets the requirements of this subsection and if the preferred stock of such corporation would meet such requirements but for the fact that it cannot be listed and registered as required because it is nonvoting stock, such preferred stock shall be treated as meeting the requirements of this subsection.

Any amount of a withdrawal remaining after the application of the preceding sentence shall be treated as a nonqualified withdrawal.

(5) If any property the basis of which was reduced under paragraph (2), (3), or (4) is disposed of, any gain realized on such disposition, to the extent it does not exceed the aggregate reduction in the basis of such property under such paragraphs, shall be treated as an amount referred to in subsection (h)(3)(A) of this section which was withdrawn on the date of such disposition.
Subject to such conditions and requirements as may be provided in joint regulations, the preceding sentence shall not apply to a disposition where there is a redeposit in an amount determined under joint regulations which will, insofar as practicable, restore the fund to the position it was in before the withdrawal.

(B) made in a taxable year beginning after 1971, shall be determined and published jointly by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary and shall bear a relationship to 8 percent which the Secretaries determine under joint regulations to be comparable to the relationship which the money rates and investment yields for the calendar year immediately preceding the beginning of the taxable year bear to the money rates and investment yields for the calendar year 1970.

(5) Amount not withdrawn from fund after 25 years from deposit taxed as nonqualified withdrawal.—

(A) In general.—The applicable percentage of any amount which remains in a capital construction fund at the close of the 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, or 30th taxable year following the taxable year for which such amount was deposited shall be treated as a nonqualified withdrawal in accordance with the following table:

(D) Authority to treat excess funds as withdrawn.—If the Secretary determines that the balance in any capital construction fund exceeds the amount which is appropriate to meet the vessel construction program objectives of the person who established such fund, the amount of such excess shall be treated as a nonqualified withdrawal under subparagraph (A) unless such person develops appropriate program objectives within 3 years to dissipate such excess.

(E) Amounts in fund on january 1, 1987.—For purposes of this paragraph, all amounts in a capital construction fund on January 1, 1987, shall be treated as deposited in such fund on such date.

(6) Nonqualified withdrawals taxed at highest marginal rate.—

(i) by excluding such withdrawal from gross income, and

(ii) by increasing the tax imposed by chapter 1 of such Code by the product of the amount of such withdrawal and the highest rate of tax specified in section 1 (section 11 in the case of a corporation) of such Code [26 U.S.C. 1, 11].

With respect to the portion of any nonqualified withdrawal made out of the capital gain account during a taxable year to which section 1(h) or 1201(a) of such Code [26 U.S.C. 1(h), 1201(a)] applies, the rate of tax taken into account under the preceding sentence shall not exceed 20 percent (34 percent in the case of a corporation).

(B) Tax benefit rule.—If any portion of a nonqualified withdrawal is properly attributable to deposits (other than earnings on deposits) made by the taxpayer in any taxable year which did not reduce the taxpayer's liability for tax under chapter 1 [26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.] for any taxable year preceding the taxable year in which such withdrawal occurs—

(i) such portion shall not be taken into account under subparagraph (A), and

(ii) an amount equal to such portion shall be treated as allowed as a deduction under section 172 of such Code [26 U.S.C. 172] for the taxable year in which such withdrawal occurs.

(C) Coordination with deduction for net operating losses.—Any nonqualified withdrawal excluded from gross income under subparagraph (A) shall be excluded in determining taxable income under section 172(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [26 U.S.C. 172(b)(2)].

Under joint regulations—

(1) a transfer of a fund from one person to another person in a transaction to which section 381 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [26 U.S.C. 381] applies may be treated as if such transaction did not constitute a nonqualified withdrawal, and

(2) a similar rule shall be applied in the case of a continuation of a partnership (within the meaning of subchapter K 1 of such Code [26 U.S.C. 701 et seq.]).

(j) Treatment of existing funds; relation of old to new fund

(1) Any person who was maintaining a fund or funds (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as “old fund”) under this section (as in effect before the enactment of this subsection) may elect to continue such old fund but—

§1181. Transfer of vessels to foreign registry on default of United States

(a) Application; hearing; grant or denial

The contractor, upon compliance with the provisions of this section, may transfer to foreign registry the vessels covered by any operating-differential subsidy contract held by him, in the event that the United States defaults upon such contract or cancels it without just cause.
Any contractor desiring to transfer any such vessel to foreign registry upon such default or cancelation shall file an application in writing with the Secretary of Transportation setting forth its contentions with respect to the lack of just cause or lawful grounds for such default or cancelation.
The Secretary of Transportation shall afford the contractor an opportunity for a hearing within twenty days after such contractor files written application therefor, and after the testimony, if any, in such hearing has been reduced to writing and filed with the Secretary of Transportation, he shall, within a reasonable time, grant or deny the application by order.

(b) Appeal from denial of application

If any such application is denied, the contractor may obtain a review of the order of denial in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, by filing in such court, within twenty days after the entry of such order, a written petition praying that the order of the Secretary of Transportation be set aside.
A copy of such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Secretary of Transportation or any officer designated by him for that purpose, and thereupon the Secretary of Transportation shall file in the court the record upon which the order complained of was entered, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. Upon the filing of such petition such court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether such cancelation or default was without just cause, and to affirm or set aside such order.
The judgment and decree of the court affirming or setting aside any such order of the Secretary of Transportation shall be final.

(c) Effectiveness of transfer

No transfer of vessels to foreign registry under this section shall become effective until any indebtedness to the Government or to any citizen of the United States, secured by such vessels, has been paid or discharged, and until after the expiration of ninety days from the date of final determination of the application or the appeal, if any.
Within such ninety-day period the Secretary of Transportation may (1) with the consent of the contractor purchase the vessels at cost to the contractor plus cost of capital improvements thereon, less 4 per centum annual depreciation upon such vessel, and the actual depreciated costs of capital improvements thereon, or (2) reinstate the contract and adjust or settle the default found by the Secretary of Transportation or the court to exist.

§1183. Off-season cruises by passenger vessels

(a) “Passenger vessel” defined

In this section, “passenger vessel” means a vessel which (1) is of not less than ten thousand gross tons, and (2) has accommodations for not less than one hundred passengers.

(b) Authorization for payment of subsidy

If the Secretary of Transportation finds that the operation of any passenger vessel with respect to which a contract for the payment of an operating-differential subsidy has been entered into under section 1173 of this Appendix effective before January 2, 1960, is not required for all of each year, in order to furnish adequate service on the service, route, or line covered by such contract, he may amend such contract to agree to pay an operating-differential subsidy for operation of the vessel (1) on such service, route, or line for some part or no part of each year, and (2) on cruises for all or part of each year if such specific cruise is approved by the Secretary of Transportation under subsection (e) of this section: Provided, however, That no such vessel may cruise for more than seven months of each year to ports which are regularly served by another United States-flag passenger vessel pursuant to an operating-differential subsidy contract.

(c) Authorization for payment of subsidy to passenger vessels providing domestic service

The Secretary of Transportation may authorize passenger vessels under operating-differential subsidy contracts to provide domestic service between specified ports while the vessels are on voyages in an essential service in the foreign commerce of the United States without reduction of operating-differential subsidy and the partial payback of construction-differential subsidy for operating in the domestic trades, if he finds that such domestic service will not result in a substantial deviation from the service, route, or line for which operating-differential subsidy is paid and will not adversely affect service on such service, route, or line.

(d) Conditions for cruises or domestic service while on voyages in an essential service in foreign commerce

When a vessel is being operated on cruises or has been authorized under this section to provide domestic passenger services while on voyages in an essential service in foreign commerce of the United States—

(1) except as provided in subdivision (4) of this subsection, it shall carry no mail unless required by law, or cargo except passengers’ luggage, except between those ports between which it may carry mail and cargo on its regular service assigned by contract;

(2) it may not carry one-way passengers between those ports served by another United States carrier on its regular service assigned by contract, without the consent of such carrier, except between those ports between which it may carry one-way passengers on its own regular service assigned by contract;

(3) it shall stop at other domestic ports only for the same time and the same purpose as is permitted with respect to a foreign-flag vessel which is carrying passengers who embarked at a domestic port, except that a cruise may end at a different port or coast from that where it began and may embark or disembark passengers at other domestic ports, either when not involving transportation in the domestic offshore trade in competition with a United States-flag passenger vessel offering berth service therein, or, if involving such transportation, with the consent of such carrier: Provided, however, That nothing herein shall be construed to repeal or modify section 1223(a) of this Appendix.

(4) Any other provisions of this chapter or of the Shipping Act, 1916 [46 App. U.S.C. 801 et seq.], to the contrary notwithstanding, with the approval of the Secretary of Transportation, it may carry cargo and mail between ports to the extent such carriage is not in direct competition with a carrier offering United States-flag berth service between those ports, or, if such carriage is in direct competition with one or more carriers offering United States-flag berth service between such ports, with the consent of the next scheduled United States-flag carrier, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld in the judgment of the Maritime Administrator.

Section 1175(c) of this Appendix shall not apply to cruises authorized under this section.
Notwithstanding the applicable provisions of sections 1175(a) and 1156 of this Appendix requiring the reduction of operating differential subsidy and the partial payback of construction differential subsidy for operating in the domestic trades, such reduction of operating subsidy and partial payback of construction subsidy under sections 1175(a) and 1156, respectively, of this Appendix, shall not apply to cruises or domestic services authorized under this section.

(e) Application for approval of cruise; notice to other American flag operators

Upon the application of any operator for approval of a specific cruise, the Secretary of Transportation, after notice to all other American flag operators who may be affected and after affording all such operators an opportunity to submit written data, views or arguments, with or without opportunity to present the same orally in any manner, and after consideration of all relevant matter presented, shall approve the proposed cruise, if he determines that the proposed cruise will not substantially adversely affect an existing operator's service performed with passenger vessels of United States registry.
Such approval shall not be given more than two years in advance of the beginning of the cruise.

§1204. Construction and chartering of vessels for unsuccessful routes; purchase of vessel by charterer; purchase price; operation of vessel in foreign trade

If the Secretary of Transportation shall find that any trade route (determined by the Secretary of Transportation to be an essential trade route as provided in section 1121 of this Appendix) cannot be successfully developed and maintained and the Secretary of Transportation's replacement program cannot be achieved under private operation of such trade route by a citizen of the United States with vessels registered under the laws thereof, without further Government aid in addition to the financial aids authorized under subchapters V and VI of this chapter, the Secretary of Transportation is authorized to have constructed, in private shipyards or in navy yards, the vessel or vessels of the types deemed necessary for such trade route, and to demise such new vessel or vessels, or bare-boat charter to the American-flag operator established on such trade route, without advertisement or competition, upon an annual charter hire of not less than 4 per centum of the price (herein referred to as the “foreign cost”) at which such vessel or vessels would be sold if constructed under subchapter V of this chapter plus an amount equal to (i) the sum of a percentage of the depreciated foreign cost computed annually upon the basis of a twenty-five year life of the vessel determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the term of the charter, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum, plus (ii) an allowance adequate in the judgment of the Secretary of Transportation to cover administrative costs.
Such charter may contain an option to the charterer to purchase such vessel or vessels from the Secretary of Transportation within five years after delivery thereof under the charter, upon the same terms and conditions as are provided in subchapter V of this chapter for the purchase of new vessels from the Secretary of Transportation, except that (a) the purchase price shall be the foreign cost less depreciation to the date of purchase based upon a twenty-five year life; (b) the required cash payment payable at the time of such purchase shall be 25 per centum of the purchase price as so determined; (c) the charter may provide that all or any part of the charter hire paid in excess of the minimum charter hire provided for in this section may be credited against the cash payment payable at the time of such purchase; (d) the balance of the purchase price shall be paid within the years remaining of the twenty-five years after the date of delivery of the vessel under the charter and in approximately equal annual installments, except that the first of said installments, which shall be payable upon the next ensuing anniversary date of such delivery under the charter, shall be a proportionate part of the annual installment, interest to be payable upon the unpaid balances from the date of purchase, at a rate not less than (i) a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities of such loans, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum, plus (ii) an allowance adequate in the judgment of the Secretary of Transportation to cover administrative costs.

Such charter shall provide for operation of the vessel exclusively in foreign trade, or on a round-the-world voyage, or on a round voyage from the west coast of the United States to a European port or ports which includes intercoastal ports of the United States, or a round voyage from the Atlantic coast of the United States to the Orient which includes intercoastal ports of the United States, or on a voyage in foreign trade on which the vessel may stop at the State of Hawaii, or an island possession or island Territory of the United States, and if the vessel is operated in the domestic trade on any of the above-enumerated services the charterer will pay annually to the Secretary of Transportation that proportion of one-twenty-fifth of the difference between the domestic and foreign cost of such vessel as the gross revenue derived from the domestic trade bears to the gross revenue derived from the entire voyages completed during the preceding year.

§1241d. Findings and declarations with respect to export transportation of agricultural commodities

(a) The Congress finds and declares—

(2) that both industries must compete in international markets increasingly dominated by foreign trade barriers and the subsidization practices of foreign governments; and

(3) that increased agricultural exports and the utilization of United States merchant vessels contribute positively to the United States balance of trade and generate employment opportunities in the United States.

(b) It is therefore declared to be the purpose and policy of the Congress in sections 1241d to 1241p of this Appendix—

(1) to enable the Department of Agriculture to plan its export programs effectively, by clarifying the ocean transportation requirements applicable to such programs;

(2) to take immediate and positive steps to promote the growth of the cargo carrying capacity of the United States merchant marine;

(3) to expand international trade in United States agricultural commodities and products and to develop, maintain, and expand markets for United States agricultural exports;

(4) to improve the efficiency of administration of both the commodity purchasing and selling and the ocean transportation activities associated with export programs sponsored by the Department of Agriculture;

(5) to stimulate and promote both the agricultural and maritime industries of the United States and encourage cooperative efforts by both industries to address their common problems; and

(6) to provide in this chapter for the appropriate disposition of these findings and purposes.

Reimbursement of any such costs shall be made with appropriated funds, as provided in this section, rather than through cancellation of notes.

(e) Notification of Congress respecting failure to obtain funds necessary for financing

Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, in the event that the Secretary of Transportation is unable to obtain the funds necessary to finance the increased ocean freight charges resulting from the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) of this section and section 1241f(a) of this Appendix, the Secretary of Transportation shall so notify the Congress within 10 working days of the discovery of such insufficiency.

When any vessel is taken or used under authority of this section, upon which vessel a construction-differential subsidy has been allowed and paid, the value of the vessel at the time of its taking shall be determined as provided in section 1212 of this Appendix, and in determining the value of any vessel taken or used, on which a construction-differential subsidy has not been paid, the value of any national defense features previously paid for by the United States shall be excluded.

(c) Charter of vessels; compensation; reimbursement for loss or damage

If any property is taken and used under authority of this section, but the ownership thereof is not required by the United States, the Secretary of Transportation, at the time of the taking or as soon thereafter as the exigencies of the situation may permit, shall transmit to the person entitled to the possession of such property a charter setting forth the terms which, in the Secretary's judgment, should govern the relationships between the United States and such person and a statement of the rate of hire which, in the Secretary's judgment, will be just compensation for the use of such property and for the services required under the terms of such charter.
If such person does not execute and deliver such charter and accept such rate of hire, the Secretary of Transportation shall pay to such person as a tentative advance only, on account of such just compensation a sum equal to 75 per centum of such rate of hire as the same may from time to time be due under the terms of the charter so tendered, and such person shall be entitled to sue the United States in a court having jurisdiction of such claims to recover such amounts as would be equal to just compensation for the use of the property and for the services required in connection with such use: Provided, however, That in the event of an election by such person to reject the rate of hire fixed by the Secretary of Transportation and to sue in the courts, the excess of any amounts advanced on account of just compensation over the amount of the court judgment will be required to be refunded.
In the event of loss or damage to such property, due to operation of a risk assumed by the United States under the terms of a charter prescribed in this subsection, but no valuation of such vessel or other property or mode of compensation has been agreed to, the United States shall pay just compensation for such loss or damage, to the extent the person entitled thereto is not reimbursed therefor through policies of insurance against such loss or damage.

(d) Determination of amount of compensation

In all cases, the just compensation authorized by this section shall be determined and paid by the Secretary of Transportation as soon as practicable, but if the amount of just compensation determined by the Secretary is unsatisfactory to the person entitled thereto; such person shall be paid, as a tentative advance only, 75 per centum of the amount so determined and shall be entitled to sue the United States to recover such amount as would equal just compensation therefor, in the manner provided for by sections 1346 and 1491 of title 28: Provided, however, That in that event of an election to reject the amount determined by the Secretary of Transportation and to sue in the courts, the excess of any amounts advanced on account of just compensation over the amount of the court judgment will be required to be refunded.

The existence of any valid claim by way of mortgage or maritime claim or attachment lien upon such vessel shall not prevent the taking thereof pursuant to this section: Provided, however, That in the event any such claim exists the Secretary of Transportation may in his discretion deposit such portion of the compensation hereunder, or advances on account thereof, as may equal but not exceed the amount of such claims in respect of the vessel, with the Treasurer of the United States, and the fund so deposited shall be available for the payment of such compensation, and shall be subject to be applied to the payment of the amount of any valid claim by way of mortgage or maritime lien or attachment lien upon such vessel, or of any stipulation therefor in a court of the United States, or of any State, subsisting at the time of such requisition or taking of title or possession; the holder of any such claim may commence prior to June 30, 1943, or within six months after the first such deposit with the Treasurer and publication of notice thereof in the Federal Register, whichever date is later, and maintain in the United States district court from whose custody such vessel has been or may be taken or in whose territorial jurisdiction the vessel was lying at the time of requisitioning or taking of title or possession, a suit in admiralty according to the principles of libels in rem against the fund, which shall proceed and be heard and determined according to the principles of law and to the rules of practice obtaining in like cases between private parties, and any decree in said suit shall be paid out of the first and all subsequent deposits of compensation; and such suit shall be commenced in the manner provided by section 742 of this Appendix and service of process shall be made in the manner therein provided by service upon the United States attorney and by mailing by registered mail to the Attorney General and the Secretary of Transportation and due notice shall under order of the court be given to all interested persons, and any decree shall be subject to appeal and revision as now provided in other cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.

(e) Use of vessels by Secretary; transfer to other departments or agencies; reimbursement of Secretary

The Secretary of Transportation is authorized to repair, recondition, reconstruct, and operate, or charter for operation, any property acquired under authority of this section.
The Secretary of Transportation is further authorized to transfer the possession or control of any such property to any department or agency of the Government of the United States upon such terms and conditions as may be approved by the President.
In case of any such transfer the department or agency to which the transfer is made shall promptly reimburse the Secretary of Transportation for the Department of Transportation's expenditures on account of just compensation, purchase price, repairs, reconditioning, reconstruction, or charter hire for the property transferred.

(b) Adjustment of obligations and arrangements for maintenance of essential vessels

For the purposes of preserving in the national interest the full availability and usefulness of essential vessels, which, under the provisions of the Neutrality Act of 1939 [22 U.S.C. 441 et seq.] (or any proclamation issued thereunder), or compatibly with the national interest, cannot be operated in the service, route, or line to which such vessels are assigned pursuant to this chapter, or in which they would otherwise be operated, the Secretary of Transportation is authorized to make adjustments of obligations in respect to such vessels and to make arrangements for the maintenance of such vessels, subject to the provisions of this section and to such rules and regulations as the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe as necessary or appropriate for carrying out the purposes and provisions of this section.
If the Secretary of Transportation, upon written application in respect of any essential vessel, determines after such examination, investigation, and proceedings as he deems desirable, that (1) the operation of such vessel in the service, route, or line to which such vessel is assigned pursuant to this chapter, or in which it would otherwise be operated, is either (A) not lawful under the Neutrality Act of 1939 (or any proclamation issued thereunder), or (B) not compatible with the maintenance of availability of such vessel for purposes of national defense and commerce, (2) it is not feasible under existing law to employ such vessel in any other service or operation in either the foreign or domestic trades (except temporary or emergency operation under subsection (c)(5) hereof), and (3) the applicant, by reason of the restrictions of the Neutrality Act of 1939, or the withdrawal of vessels for national-defense purposes under clause (1) hereof, is not earning or will not earn a fair and reasonable return on the capital necessarily employed in its business, the Secretary of Transportation may make adjustments and arrangements with the applicant as provided in subsection (c) of this section, which shall continue in effect only during the circumstances above described.

(1) Lay-up of the vessel by the owner or, at the option of the Secretary of Transportation, in the custody of the Secretary of Transportation, with payment or reimbursement by the Secretary of Transportation of necessary and proper expenses thereof (including reasonable overhead and insurance), or in lieu of such payment or reimbursement, a fixed periodic allowance therefor;

(2) Postponement, for a period not in excess of the period or periods of lay-up, of the maturity date of each installment on account of the principal of obligations to the United States in respect of the vessel (whether or not such maturity date shall fall within such period or periods), or rearrangement of such maturities;

(3) Postponement or cancellation of interest accruing on such obligations during such period or periods of lay-up;

(4) Extension for a period not in excess of the period or periods of lay-up, of the twenty-year life limitation in respect of the vessel, and of the period or periods of other limitations and provisions of this chapter, insofar as they are based upon a twenty-year life;

(5) Provisions for such temporary or emergency employment of the vessel in lieu of lay-up as may be practicable, with such arrangements for management of the vessel, payment of expenses, and application of the proceeds of such employment, as the Secretary of Transportation may approve, the period or periods of such operation being included as part of the period or periods of lay-up;

(6) The payment to the Secretary of Transportation, upon termination of the arrangements with the applicant hereunder, out of the applicant's net profits, earned while such arrangements were in effect, in excess of 10 per centum per annum on the capital necessarily employed in the applicant's business, in reimbursement, to the extent that the Secretary of Transportation shall deem it necessary to carry out the purposes of this section, on account of obligations postponed or canceled and expenses incurred or paid by the Secretary of Transportation under this subsection.
For the purposes of this paragraph capital of the applicant represented by vessels of the applicant laid up or operated under this section shall not be excluded from capital necessarily employed in the applicant's business.
The Secretary of Transportation may require that the vessels so laid up or operated be security for reimbursement hereunder.

(d) Readjustment or modification of adjustments and arrangements

§1273. Authorization of Secretary to guarantee obligations

(a) Principal and interest

The Secretary is authorized to guarantee, and to enter into commitments to guarantee, the payment of the interest on, and the unpaid balance of the principal of, any obligation which is eligible to be guaranteed under this subchapter.
A guarantee, or commitment to guarantee, made by the Secretary under this subchapter shall cover 100 percent of the amount of the principal and interest of the obligation.

(b) Security interest

No obligation shall be guaranteed under this subchapter unless the obligor conveys or agrees to convey to the Secretary such security interest, which may include a mortgage or mortgages on a vessel or vessels, as the Secretary may reasonably require to protect the interest of the United States.

(c) Amount of guarantee; percentage limitation; determination of actual cost of vessel

The Secretary shall not guarantee the principal of obligations in an amount in excess of 75 per centum, or 871/2 per centum, whichever is applicable under section 1274 1 of this Appendix, of the amount, as determined by the Secretary which determination shall be conclusive, paid by or for the account of the obligor for the construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of a vessel or vessels with respect to which a security interest has been conveyed to the Secretary, unless the obligor creates an escrow fund as authorized by section 1279a of this Appendix, in which case the Secretary may guarantee 75 per centum or 871/2 per centum, whichever is applicable under section 1274 of this Appendix, of the actual cost of such vessel or vessels.

(d) Pledge of United States

The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all guarantees made under this subchapter with respect to both principal and interest, including interest, as may be provided for in the guarantee, accruing between the date of default under a guaranteed obligation and the payment in full of the guarantee.

(e) Proof of obligations

Any guarantee, or commitment to guarantee, made by the Secretary under this subchapter shall be conclusive evidence of the eligibility of the obligations for such guarantee, and the validity of any guarantee, or commitment to guarantee, so made shall be incontestable.
Notwithstanding an assumption of an obligation by the Secretary under section 1275(a) or (b) of this Appendix, the validity of the guarantee of an obligation made by the Secretary under this subchapter is unaffected and the guarantee remains in full force and effect.

(f) Limitation on outstanding amount

The aggregate unpaid principal amount of the obligations guaranteed under this section and outstanding at any one time shall not exceed $12,000,000,000, of which (1) $850,000,000 shall be limited to obligations pertaining to guarantees of obligations for fishing vessels and fishery facilities made under this subchapter, and (2) $3,000,000,000 shall be limited to obligations pertaining to guarantees of obligations for eligible export vessels.
No additional limitations may be imposed on new commitments to guarantee loans for any fiscal year, except in such amounts as established in advance in annual authorization Acts.
No vessel eligible for guarantees under this subchapter shall be denied eligibility because of its type.

(g) Restrictions on commitments to guarantee obligations on eligible export vessels

(1) The Secretary may not issue a commitment to guarantee obligations for an eligible export vessel unless, after considering—

(A) the status of pending applications for commitments to guarantee obligations for vessels documented under the laws of the United States and operating or to be operated in the domestic or foreign commerce of the United States,

(B) the economic soundness of the applications referred to in subparagraph (A), and

(C) the amount of guarantee authority available,

the Secretary determines, in the sole discretion of the Secretary, that the issuance of a commitment to guarantee obligations for an eligible export vessel will not result in the denial of an economically sound application to issue a commitment to guarantee obligations for vessels documented under the laws of the United States operating in the domestic or foreign commerce of the United States.

(2) The Secretary may not issue commitments to guarantee obligations for eligible export vessels under this section after the later of—

(A) the 5th anniversary of the date on which the Secretary publishes final regulations setting forth the application procedures for the issuance of commitments to guarantee obligations for eligible export vessels,

(B) the last day of any 5-year period in which funding and guarantee authority for obligations for eligible export vessels have been continuously available, or

(C) the last date on which those commitments may be issued under any treaty or convention entered into after November 30, 1993, that prohibits guarantee of those obligations.

(h) Risk categories

(1) The Secretary shall—

(A) establish in accordance with this subsection a system of risk categories for obligations guaranteed under this subchapter, that categorizes the relative risk of guarantees made under this subchapter with respect to the risk factors set forth in paragraph (3); and

(B) determine for each of the risk categories a subsidy rate equivalent to the cost of obligations in the category, expressed as a percentage of the amount guaranteed under this subchapter for obligations in the category.

(2)(A) Before making a guarantee under this section for an obligation, the Secretary shall apply the risk factors set forth in paragraph (3) to place the obligation in a risk category established under paragraph (1)(A).

(B) The Secretary shall consider the aggregate amount available to the Secretary for making guarantees under this subchapter to be reduced by the amount determined by multiplying—

(i) the amount guaranteed under this subchapter for an obligation, by

(ii) the subsidy rate for the category in which the obligation is placed under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.

(C) The estimated cost to the Government of a guarantee made by the Secretary under this subchapter for an obligation is deemed to be the amount determined under subparagraph (B) for the obligation.

(D) The Secretary may not guarantee obligations under this subchapter after the aggregate amount available to the Secretary under appropriations Acts for the cost of loan guarantees is required by subparagraph (B) to be considered reduced to zero.

(3) The risk factors referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) are the following:

(A) If applicable, the country risk for each eligible export vessel financed or to be financed by an obligation.

(B) The period for which an obligation is guaranteed or to be guaranteed.

(C) The amount of an obligation, which is guaranteed or to be guaranteed, in relation to the total cost of the project financed or to be financed by the obligation.

(b) Contents of obligations

Obligations guaranteed under this subchapter—

(1) shall have an obligor approved by the Secretary as responsible and possessing the ability, experience, financial resources, and other qualifications necessary to the adequate operation and maintenance of the vessel or vessels which serve as security for the guarantee of the Secretary;

(4) shall provide for payments by the obligor satisfactory to the Secretary;

(5) shall bear interest (exclusive of charges for the guarantee and service charges, if any) at rates not to exceed such per centum per annum on the unpaid principal as the Secretary determines to be reasonable, taking into account the range of interest rates prevailing in the private market for similar loans and the risks assumed by the Secretary;

(6) shall provide, or a related agreement shall provide, that if the vessel used as security for the guarantee of the Secretary is a delivered vessel, the vessel shall be in class A–1, American Bureau of Shipping, or shall meet such other standards as may be acceptable to the Secretary, with all required certificates, including but not limited to, marine inspection certificates of the United States Coast Guard or, in the case of an eligible export vessel, of the appropriate national flag authorities under a treaty, convention, or other international agreement to which the United States is a party, with all outstanding requirements and recommendations necessary for retention of class accomplished, unless the Secretary permits a deferment of such repairs, and shall be tight, stanch, strong, and well and sufficiently tackled, appareled, furnished, and equipped, and in every respect seaworthy and in good running condition and repair, and in all respects fit for service; and

The Secretary may not establish, as a condition of eligibility for guarantee under this subchapter, a minimum principal amount for an obligation covering the reconstruction or reconditioning of a fishing vessel or fishery facility.
For purposes of this subchapter, the reconstruction or reconditioning of a fishing vessel or fishery facility does not include the routine minor repair of maintenance of the vessel or facility.

(c) Security

(1) The security for the guarantee of an obligation by the Secretary under this subchapter may relate to more than one vessel and may consist of any combination of types of security.

(2) If the security for the guarantee of an obligation by the Secretary under this subchapter relates to more than one vessel, such obligation may have the latest maturity date permissible under subsection (b) of this section with respect to any of such vessels: Provided, That the Secretary may require such payments of principal, prior to maturity, with respect to all related obligations as he deems necessary in order to maintain adequate security for his guarantee.

(d) Restrictions

(1)(A) No commitment to guarantee, or guarantee of, an obligation shall be made by the Secretary of Transportation unless the Secretary finds that the property or project with respect to which the obligation will be executed will be economically sound.
In making that determination, the Secretary shall consider—

(2)(A) The amount of a fee under this subsection for a guarantee is equal to the sum determined by adding the amounts determined under subparagraph (B) for the years in which the guarantee is in effect.

(B) The amount referred to in subparagraph (A) for a year is the present value (determined by applying the discount rate determined under subparagraph (F)) of the amount determined by multiplying—

(i) the estimated average unpaid principal amount of the obligation that will be outstanding during the year (determined in accordance with subparagraph (E)), by

(ii) the fee rate established under subparagraph (C) for the obligation for each year.

(C) The fee rate referred to in subparagraph (B)(ii) for an obligation shall be—

(i) in the case of an obligation for a delivered vessel or equipment, not less than one-half of 1 percent and not more than 1 percent, determined by the Secretary for the obligation under the formula established under subparagraph (D); or

(ii) in the case of an obligation for a vessel to be constructed, reconstructed, or reconditioned, or of equipment to be delivered, not less than one-quarter of 1 percent and not more than one-half of 1 percent, determined by the Secretary for the obligation under the formula established under subparagraph (D).

(D) The Secretary shall establish a formula for determining the fee rate for an obligation for purposes of subparagraph (C), that—

(i) is a sliding scale based on the creditworthiness of the obligor;

(ii) takes into account the security provided for a guarantee under this subchapter for the obligation; and

(iii) uses—

(I) in the case of the most creditworthy obligors, the lowest rate authorized under subparagraph (C)(i) or (ii), as applicable; and

(g) Disposition of moneys

All moneys received by the Secretary under the provisions of sections 1271 to 1276 and 1279 2 of this Appendix shall be deposited in the Fund.

During the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the Secretary of Defense receives such notice, the Secretary of Defense may disapprove the loan guarantee based on the assessment of the Secretary of the potential use of the vessel in a manner that may cause harm to United States national security interests.
The Secretary of Defense may not disapprove a loan guarantee under this section solely on the basis of the type of vessel to be constructed with the loan guarantee.
The authority of the Secretary to disapprove a loan guarantee under this section may not be delegated to any official other than a civilian officer of the Department of Defense appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.

(a) Purpose of obligations; principal and interest

Notwithstanding the provisions of this subchapter, except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, the Secretary, upon the terms the Secretary may prescribe, may guarantee or make a commitment to guarantee, payment of the principal of and interest on an obligation which aids in financing and refinancing, including reimbursement to an obligor for expenditures previously made, of a contract for construction or reconstruction of a vessel or vessels which are designed and to be employed for commercial use in the coastwise or intercoastal trade or in foreign trade as defined in section 1244 of this Appendix if—

(1) the construction or reconstruction by an applicant is made necessary to replace vessels the continued operation of which is denied by virtue of the imposition of a statutorily mandated change in standards for the operation of vessels, and where, as a matter of law, the applicant would otherwise be denied the right to continue operating vessels in the trades in which the applicant operated prior to the taking effect of the statutory or regulatory change;

(2) the applicant is presently engaged in transporting cargoes in vessels of the type and class that will be constructed or reconstructed under this section, and agrees to employ vessels constructed or reconstructed under this section as replacements only for vessels made obsolete by changes in operating standards imposed by statute;

(3) the capacity of the vessels to be constructed or reconstructed under this subchapter will not increase the cargo carrying capacity of the vessels being replaced;

(4) the Secretary has not made a determination that the market demand for the vessel over its useful life will diminish so as to make the granting of the guarantee fiduciarily imprudent; and

(5) the Secretary has considered the provisions of section 1274(d)(1)(A)(iii), (iv), and (v) of this Appendix.

(b) Limitations on length and amount of guaranteed obligations; useful life of vessel

For the purposes of this section—

(1) the maximum term for obligations guaranteed under this program may not exceed 25 years;

(2) obligations guaranteed may not exceed 871/2 percent of the actual cost or depreciated actual cost to the applicant for the construction or reconstruction of the vessel; and

(3) reconstruction cost obligations may not be guaranteed unless the vessel after reconstruction will have a useful life of at least 15 years.

The Secretary may not by rule, regulation, or procedure establish any percentage within the 871/2 percent or less limitation in paragraph (2) that is, or is intended to be, applied uniformly to all guarantees or commitments to guarantee made under this section.

(c) Security against default; fees; Vessel Replacement Guarantee Fund

(1) The Secretary shall by rule require that the applicant provide adequate security against default.
The Secretary may, in addition to any fees assessed under section 1274(e) of this Appendix, establish a Vessel Replacement Guarantee Fund into which shall be paid by obligors under this section—

(A) annual fees which may be an additional amount on the loan guarantee fee in section 1274(e) of this Appendix not to exceed an additional 1 percent; or

(B) fees based on the amount of the obligation versus the percentage of the obligor's fleet being replaced by vessels constructed or reconstructed under this section.

(2) The Vessel Replacement Guarantee Fund shall be a subaccount in the Federal Ship Financing Fund, and shall—

(A) be the depository for all moneys received by the Secretary under sections 1271 through 1276 and 1279 1 of this Appendix with respect to guarantee or commitments to guarantee made under this section;

(B) not include investigation fees payable under section 1274(f) of this Appendix which shall be paid to the Federal Ship Financing Fund; and

(C) be the depository, whenever there shall be outstanding any notes or obligations issued by the Secretary under section 1275(d) of this Appendix with respect to the Vessel Replacement Guarantee Fund, for all moneys received by the Secretary under sections 1271 through 1276 and 1279 1 of this Appendix from applicants under this section.

(d) Additional requirements

The program created by this section shall, in addition to the requirements of this section, be subject to the provisions of sections 1271 through 1273; 1274(b)(1), (4), (5), (6); 1274(e); 1274(f); 1274(h); and 1275, 1276, and 1279 1 of this Appendix; except that the Federal Ship Financing Fund is not liable for any guarantees or commitments to guarantee issued under this section.

(2) In respect of hull insurance, the valuation in the policy for actual or constructive total loss of the vessel insured shall be a stated valuation (exclusive of National Defense features paid for by the Government) determined by the Secretary which shall not exceed the amount that would be payable if the vessel had been requisitioned for title under section 1242(a) of this Appendix at the time of the attachment of the insurance under said policy: Provided, That the insured shall have the right within sixty days after the attachment of the insurance under said policy, or within sixty days after determination of such valuation by the Secretary, whichever is later, to reject such valuation, and shall pay, at the rate provided for in said policy, premiums upon such asserted valuation as the insured shall specify at the time of rejection, but such asserted valuation shall not operate to the prejudice of the Government in any subsequent action on the policy.
In the event of the actual or constructive total loss of the vessel, if the insured has not rejected such valuation the amount of any claim therefor which is adjusted, compromised, settled, adjudged, or paid shall not exceed such stated amount, but if the insured has so rejected such valuation, the insured shall be paid as a tentative advance only, 75 per centum of such valuation so determined by the Secretary and shall be entitled to sue the United States in a court having jurisdiction of such claims to recover such valuation as would be equal to the just compensation which such court determines would have been payable if the vessel had been requisitioned for title under section 1242(a) of this Appendix at the time of the attachment of the insurance under said policy: Provided, That in the event of an election by the insured to reject the stated valuation fixed by the Secretary and to sue in the courts, the amount of the judgment will be payable without regard to the limitations contained in section 1242–1 1 of this Appendix, although the excess of any amounts advanced on account of just compensation over the amount of the court judgment will be required to be refunded.

The Secretary may allow such companies or groups of companies fair and reasonable compensation for servicing insurance written by such companies or groups of companies as underwriting agent for the Secretary.
The services of such underwriting agents may be utilized in the adjustment of claims under insurance provided by this subchapter, but no claim shall be paid unless and until it has been approved by the Secretary.

(Apr. 16, 1936, ch. 229, title I, §2, 49 Stat. 1208.)

Section Referred to in Other Sections

This section is referred to in section 1313 of this Appendix.

§1303. Responsibilities and liabilities of carrier and ship

(1) Seaworthiness

The carrier shall be bound, before and at the beginning of the voyage, to exercise due diligence to—

(a) Make the ship seaworthy;

(b) Properly man, equip, and supply the ship;

(c) Make the holds, refrigerating and cooling chambers, and all other parts of the ship in which goods are carried, fit and safe for their reception, carriage, and preservation.

(2) Cargo

The carrier shall properly and carefully load, handle, stow, carry, keep, care for, and discharge the goods carried.

(3) Contents of bill

After receiving the goods into his charge the carrier, or the master or agent of the carrier, shall, on demand of the shipper, issue to the shipper a bill of lading showing among other things—

(a) The leading marks necessary for identification of the goods as the same are furnished in writing by the shipper before the loading of such goods starts, provided such marks are stamped or otherwise shown clearly upon the goods if uncovered, or on the cases or coverings in which such goods are contained, in such a manner as should ordinarily remain legible until the end of the voyage.

(b) Either the number of packages or pieces, or the quantity or weight, as the case may be, as furnished in writing by the shipper.

(c) The apparent order and condition of the goods: Provided, That no carrier, master, or agent of the carrier, shall be bound to state or show in the bill of lading any marks, number, quantity, or weight which he has reasonable ground for suspecting not accurately to represent the goods actually received, or which he has had no reasonable means of checking.

(4) Bill as prima facie evidence

Such a bill of lading shall be prima facie evidence of the receipt by the carrier of the goods as therein described in accordance with paragraphs (3)(a), (b), and (c), of this section: Provided, That nothing in this chapter shall be construed as repealing or limiting the application of any part of chapter 801 of title 49.

(5) Guaranty of statements

The shipper shall be deemed to have guaranteed to the carrier the accuracy at the time of shipment of the marks, number, quantity, and weight, as furnished by him; and the shipper shall indemnify the carrier against all loss, damages, and expenses arising or resulting from inaccuracies in such particulars.
The right of the carrier to such indemnity shall in no way limit his responsibility and liability under the contract of carriage to any person other than the shipper.

(6) Notice of loss or damage; limitation of actions

Unless notice of loss or damage and the general nature of such loss or damage be given in writing to the carrier or his agent at the port of discharge before or at the time of the removal of the goods into the custody of the person entitled to delivery thereof under the contract of carriage, such removal shall be prima facie evidence of the delivery by the carrier of the goods as described in the bill of lading.
If the loss or damage is not apparent, the notice must be given within three days of the delivery.

Said notice of loss or damage may be endorsed upon the receipt for the goods given by the person taking delivery thereof.

The notice in writing need not be given if the state of the goods has at the time of their receipt been the subject of joint survey or inspection.

In any event the carrier and the ship shall be discharged from all liability in respect of loss or damage unless suit is brought within one year after delivery of the goods or the date when the goods should have been delivered: Provided, That if a notice of loss or damage, either apparent or concealed, is not given as provided for in this section, that fact shall not affect or prejudice the right of the shipper to bring suit within one year after the delivery of the goods or the date when the goods should have been delivered.

In the case of any actual or apprehended loss or damage the carrier and the receiver shall give all reasonable facilities to each other for inspecting and tallying the goods.

(7) “Shipped” bill of lading

After the goods are loaded the bill of lading to be issued by the carrier, master, or agent of the carrier to the shipper shall, if the shipper so demands, be a “shipped” bill of lading: Provided, That if the shipper shall have previously taken up any document of title to such goods, he shall surrender the same as against the issue of the “shipped” bill of lading, but at the option of the carrier such document of title may be noted at the port of shipment by the carrier, master, or agent with the name or names of the ship or ships upon which the goods have been shipped and the date or dates of shipment, and when so noted the same shall for the purpose of this section be deemed to constitute a “shipped” bill of lading.

(8) Limitation of liability for negligence

Any clause, covenant, or agreement in a contract of carriage relieving the carrier or the ship from liability for loss or damage to or in connection with the goods, arising from negligence, fault, or failure in the duties and obligations provided in this section, or lessening such liability otherwise than as provided in this chapter, shall be null and void and of no effect.
A benefit of insurance in favor of the carrier, or similar clause, shall be deemed to be a clause relieving the carrier from liability.

Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be liable for loss or damage arising or resulting from unseaworthiness unless caused by want of due diligence on the part of the carrier to make the ship seaworthy, and to secure that the ship is properly manned, equipped, and supplied, and to make the holds, refrigerating and cool chambers, and all other parts of the ship in which goods are carried fit and safe for their reception, carriage, and preservation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (1) of section 1303 of this Appendix.
Whenever loss or damage has resulted from unseaworthiness, the burden of proving the exercise of due diligence shall be on the carrier or other persons claiming exemption under this section.

(2) Uncontrollable causes of loss

(m) Wastage in bulk or weight or any other loss or damage arising from inherent defect, quality, or vice of the goods;

(p) Latent defects not discoverable by due diligence; and

(q) Any other cause arising without the actual fault and privity of the carrier and without the fault or neglect of the agents or servants of the carrier, but the burden of proof shall be on the person claiming the benefit of this exception to show that neither the actual fault or privity of the carrier nor the fault or neglect of the agents or servants of the carrier contributed to the loss or damage.

(3) Freedom from negligence

The shipper shall not be responsible for loss or damage sustained by the carrier or the ship arising or resulting from any cause without the act, fault, or neglect of the shipper, his agents, or his servants.

(4) Deviations

Any deviation in saving or attempting to save life or property at sea, or any reasonable deviation shall not be deemed to be an infringement or breach of this chapter or of the contract of carriage, and the carrier shall not be liable for any loss or damage resulting therefrom: Provided, however, That if the deviation is for the purpose of loading or unloading cargo or passengers it shall, prima facie, be regarded as unreasonable.

(5) Amount of liability; valuation of cargo

Neither the carrier nor the ship shall in any event be or become liable for any loss or damage to or in connection with the transportation of goods in an amount exceeding $500 per package lawful money of the United States, or in case of goods not shipped in packages, per customary freight unit, or the equivalent of that sum in other currency, unless the nature and value of such goods have been declared by the shipper before shipment and inserted in the bill of lading.
This declaration, if embodied in the bill of lading, shall be prima facie evidence, but shall not be conclusive on the carrier.

By agreement between the carrier, master, or agent of the carrier, and the shipper another maximum amount than that mentioned in this paragraph may be fixed: Provided, That such maximum shall not be less than the figure above named.
In no event shall the carrier be liable for more than the amount of damage actually sustained.

Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be responsible in any event for loss or damage to or in connection with the transportation of the goods if the nature or value thereof has been knowingly and fraudulently misstated by the shipper in the bill of lading.

(6) Inflammable, explosive, or dangerous cargo

Goods of an inflammable, explosive, or dangerous nature to the shipment whereof the carrier, master or agent of the carrier, has not consented with knowledge of their nature and character, may at any time before discharge be landed at any place or destroyed or rendered innocuous by the carrier without compensation, and the shipper of such goods shall be liable for all damages and expenses directly or indirectly arising out of or resulting from such shipment.
If any such goods shipped with such knowledge and consent shall become a danger to the ship or cargo, they may in like manner be landed at any place, or destroyed or rendered innocuous by the carrier without liability on the part of the carrier except to general average, if any.

Any agreement so entered into shall have full legal effect: Provided, That this section shall not apply to ordinary commercial shipments made in the ordinary course of trade but only to other shipments where the character or condition of the property to be carried or the circumstances, terms, and conditions under which the carriage is to be performed are such as reasonably to justify a special agreement.

(B) issue a detention order removing or excluding a container from service until the owner of the container establishes to the Secretary's satisfaction that the container meets the standards of the Convention, if the container is subject to this chapter and does not have a valid safety approval plate attached to it, or if there is significant evidence that such a container bearing a safety approval plate is in a condition which creates an obvious risk to safety; and

(C) take whatever other appropriate action he deems necessary, including issuance of any necessary orders, to remove the container involved from service, or restrict its use, in those instances where he finds that a container is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter or the Convention but does not present an obvious risk to safety.

The Secretary may permit the movement to another location of a container which he finds to be unsafe or which does not have a valid safety approval plate affixed to it, under whatever restriction he considers necessary and consistent with the intent of the Convention, for repair or other appropriate disposition.

(2) Beginning on January 1, 1985, the Secretary may examine or require to be examined any existing container in international transport.

Funds received by the Secretary in reimbursement shall be credited to the appropriations bearing the cost thereof.

Upon failure of any person to pay any penalty assessed against him by the Secretary, the Secretary shall request the Attorney General to begin an action in any district court of the United States to recover the amount of the penalty unpaid.

(1) Except with regard to bulk cargo, forest products, recycled metal scrap, new assembled motor vehicles, waste paper, and paper waste, each common carrier and conference shall keep open to public inspection in an automated tariff system, tariffs showing all its rates, charges, classifications, rules, and practices between all points or ports on its own route and on any through transportation route that has been established.
However, common carriers shall not be required to state separately or otherwise reveal in tariffs the inland divisions of a through rate.
Tariffs shall—

(A) state the places between which cargo will be carried;

(B) list each classification of cargo in use;

(C) state the level of ocean transportation intermediary, as defined in section 1702(17)(A) of this Appendix, compensation, if any, by a carrier or conference;

(D) state separately each terminal or other charge, privilege, or facility under the control of the carrier or conference and any rules or regulations that in any way change, affect, or determine any part or the aggregate of the rates or charges;

(E) include sample copies of any bill of lading, contract of affreightment, or other document evidencing the transportation agreement; and

(F) include copies of any loyalty contract, omitting the shipper's name.

(2) Tariffs shall be made available electronically to any person, without time, quantity, or other limitation, through appropriate access from remote locations, and a reasonable charge may be assessed for such access.
No charge may be assessed a Federal agency for such access.

(b) Time-volume rates

Rates shown in tariffs filed under subsection (a) of this section may vary with the volume of cargo offered over a specified period of time.

(c) Service contracts

(1) In general

An individual ocean common carrier or an agreement between or among ocean common carriers may enter into a service contract with one or more shippers subject to the requirements of this chapter.
The exclusive remedy for a breach of a contract entered into under this subsection shall be an action in an appropriate court, unless the parties otherwise agree.
In no case may the contract dispute resolution forum be controlled by or in any way affiliated with a controlled carrier as defined in section 1702(8) of this Appendix, or by the government which owns or controls the carrier.

(2) Filing requirements

Except for service contracts dealing with bulk cargo, forest products, recycled metal scrap, new assembled motor vehicles, waste paper, or paper waste, each contract entered into under this subsection by an individual ocean common carrier or an agreement shall be filed confidentially with the Commission.
Each service contract shall include the following essential terms—

(A) the origin and destination port ranges;

(B) the origin and destination geographic areas in the case of through intermodal movements;

(C) the commodity or commodities involved;

(D) the minimum volume or portion;

(E) the line-haul rate;

(F) the duration;

(G) service commitments; and

(H) the liquidated damages for nonperformance, if any.

(3) Publication of certain terms

When a service contract is filed confidentially with the Commission, a concise statement of the essential terms described in paragraphs 2(A),1 (C), (D), and (F) shall be published and made available to the general public in tariff format.

(4) Disclosure of certain terms

(A) An ocean common carrier, which is a party to or is subject to the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement with a labor organization, shall, in response to a written request by such labor organization, state whether it is responsible for the following work at dock areas and within port areas in the United States with respect to cargo transportation under a service contract described in paragraph (1) of this subsection—

(i) the movement of the shipper's cargo on a dock area or within the port area or to or from railroad cars on a dock area or within the port area;

(ii) the assignment of intraport carriage of the shipper's cargo between areas on a dock or within the port area;

(iii) the assignment of the carriage of the shipper's cargo between a container yard on a dock area or within the port area and a rail yard adjacent to such container yard; and

(iv) the assignment of container freight station work and container maintenance and repair work performed at a dock area or within the port area.

(B) The common carrier shall provide the information described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph to the requesting labor organization within a reasonable period of time.

(C) This paragraph requires the disclosure of information by an ocean common carrier only if there exists an applicable and otherwise lawful collective bargaining agreement which pertains to that carrier.
No disclosure made by an ocean common carrier shall be deemed to be an admission or agreement that any work is covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
Any dispute regarding whether any work is covered by a collective bargaining agreement and the responsibility of the ocean common carrier under such agreement shall be resolved solely in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures contained in the collective bargaining agreement and the National Labor Relations Act [29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.], and without reference to this paragraph.

(D) Nothing in this paragraph shall have any effect on the lawfulness or unlawfulness under this chapter, the National Labor Relations Act [29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.], the Taft-Hartley Act [29 U.S.C. 141 et seq.], the Federal Trade Commission Act [15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.], the antitrust laws, or any other Federal or State law, or any revisions or amendments thereto, of any collective bargaining agreement or element thereof, including any element that constitutes an essential term of a service contract under this subsection.

(E) For purposes of this paragraph the terms “dock area” and “within the port area” shall have the same meaning and scope as in the applicable collective bargaining agreement between the requesting labor organization and the carrier.

(d) Tariff rates

No new or initial rate or change in an existing rate that results in an increased cost to the shipper may become effective earlier than 30 calendar days after publication.
The Commission, for good cause, may allow such a new or initial rate or change to become effective in less than 30 calendar days.
A change in an existing rate that results in a decreased cost to the shipper may become effective upon publication.

(e) Refunds

The Commission may, upon application of a carrier or shipper, permit a common carrier or conference to refund a portion of freight charges collected from a shipper or to waive the collection of a portion of the charges from a shipper if—

(1) there is an error in a,2 in failing to publish a new tariff, or an error in quoting a tariff, and the refund will not result in discrimination among shippers, ports, or carriers;

(2) the common carrier or conference has, prior to filing an application for authority to make a refund for an error in a tariff or a failure to publish a tariff, published a new tariff that sets forth the rate on which the refund or waiver would be based; and

(3) the application for refund or waiver is filed with the Commission within 180 days from the date of shipment.

§1708. Controlled carriers

(a) Controlled carrier rates

No controlled carrier subject to this section may maintain rates or charges in its tariffs or service contracts, or charge or assess rates, that are below a level that is just and reasonable, nor may any such carrier establish 1 maintain, or enforce unjust or unreasonable classifications, rules, or regulations in those tariffs or service contracts.
An unjust or unreasonable classification, rule, or regulation means one that results or is likely to result in the carriage or handling of cargo at rates or charges that are below a just and reasonable level.
The Commission may, at any time after notice and hearing, prohibit the publication or use of any rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations that the controlled carrier has failed to demonstrate to be just and reasonable.
In a proceeding under this subsection, the burden of proof is on the controlled carrier to demonstrate that its rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations are just and reasonable.
Rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations that have been suspended or prohibited by the Commission are void and their use is unlawful.

(b) Rate standards

For the purpose of this section, in determining whether rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations by a controlled carrier are just and reasonable, the Commission shall take into account whether the rates or charges which have been published or assessed or which would result from the pertinent classifications, rules, or regulations are below a level which is fully compensatory to the controlled carrier based upon that carrier's actual costs or upon its constructive costs.
For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term “constructive costs” means the costs of another carrier, other than a controlled carrier, operating similar vessels and equipment in the same or a similar trade.
The Commission may also take into account other appropriate factors, including but not limited to, whether—

(1) the rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations are the same as or similar to those published or assessed or assessed 2 by other carriers in the same trade;

(2) the rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations are required to assure movement of particular cargo in the trade; or

(3) the rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations are required to maintain acceptable continuity, level, or quality of common carrier service to or from affected ports.

(c) Effective date of rates

Notwithstanding section 1707(d) of this Appendix and except for service contracts, the rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations of controlled carriers may not, without special permission of the Commission, become effective sooner than the 30th day after the date of publication.
Each controlled carrier shall, upon the request of the Commission, file, within 20 days of request (with respect to its existing or proposed rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations), a statement of justification that sufficiently details the controlled carrier's need and purpose for such rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations upon which the Commission may reasonably base its determination of the lawfulness thereof.

(d) Prohibition of rates

Within 120 days after the receipt of information requested by the Commission under this section, the Commission shall determine whether the rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations of a controlled carrier may be unjust and unreasonable.
Whenever the Commission is of the opinion that the rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations published or assessed by a controlled carrier may be unjust and unreasonable, the Commission shall issue an order to the controlled carrier to show cause why those rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations should not be prohibited.
Pending a determination as to their lawfulness in such a proceeding, the Commission may suspend the rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations at any time before their effective date.
In the case of rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations that have already become effective, the Commission may, upon the issuance of an order to show cause, suspend those rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations on not less than 30 days’ notice to the controlled carrier.
No period of suspension under this subsection may be greater than 180 days.
Whenever the Commission has suspended any rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations under this subsection, the affected controlled carrier may publish new rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations to take effect immediately during the suspension period in lieu of the suspended rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations—except that the Commission may reject the new rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations if it is of the opinion that they are unjust and unreasonable.

(e) Presidential review

Concurrently with the publication thereof, the Commission shall transmit to the President each order of suspension or final order of prohibition of rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations of a controlled carrier subject to this section.
Within 10 days after the receipt or the effective date of the Commission order, the President may request the Commission in writing to stay the effect of the Commission's order if the President finds that the stay is required for reasons of national defense or foreign policy, which reasons shall be specified in the report.
Notwithstanding any other law, the Commission shall immediately grant the request by the issuance of an order in which the President's request shall be described.
During any such stay, the President shall, whenever practicable, attempt to resolve the matter in controversy by negotiation with representatives of the applicable foreign governments.

(f) Exceptions

This section does not apply to—

(1) a controlled carrier of a state whose vessels are entitled by a treaty of the United States to receive national or most-favored-nation treatment; or

(2) a trade served exclusively by controlled carriers.

(Pub. L. 98–237, §9, Mar. 20, 1984, 98 Stat. 76; Pub. L. 102–100, §5, Aug. 17, 1991, 105 Stat. 492; Pub. L. 105–258, title I, §108, Oct. 14, 1998, 112 Stat. 1908.)

(12) knowingly and willfully enter into a service contract with an ocean transportation intermediary that does not have a tariff and a bond, insurance, or other surety as required by sections 1707 and 1718 of this Appendix, or with an affiliate of such ocean transportation intermediary; or

(13) knowingly disclose, offer, solicit, or receive any information concerning the nature, kind, quantity, destination, consignee, or routing of any property tendered or delivered to a common carrier without the consent of the shipper or consignee if that information—

(A) may be used to the detriment or prejudice of the shipper or consignee;

(B) may improperly disclose its business transaction to a competitor; or

(C) may be used to the detriment or prejudice of any common carrier.

Nothing in paragraph (13) shall be construed to prevent providing such information, in response to legal process, to the United States, the Commission, or to an independent neutral body operating within the scope of its authority to fulfill the policing obligations of the parties to an agreement effective under this chapter.
Nor shall it be prohibited for any ocean common carrier that is a party to a conference agreement approved under this chapter, or any receiver, trustee, lessee, agent, or employee of that carrier, or any other person authorized by that carrier to receive information, to give information to the conference or any person, firm, corporation, or agency designated by the conference, or to prevent the conference or its designee from soliciting or receiving information for the purpose of determining whether a shipper or consignee has breached an agreement with the conference or its member lines or for the purpose of determining whether a member of the conference has breached the conference agreement, or for the purpose of compiling statistics of cargo movement, but the use of such information for any other purpose prohibited by this chapter or any other Act is prohibited.

Upon request by the Commission, the Secretary of the Treasury shall, with respect to the vessel concerned, refuse or revoke any clearance required by section 91 of this Appendix.

(2) security measures to restrict access to cargo, vessels, and dockside property to authorized personnel only;

(3) additional security on board vessels;

(4) licensing or certification of compliance with appropriate security standards; and

(5) other appropriate measures to prevent unlawful acts against passengers and crews on board vessels.
