(4) the Heye Museum is housed in facilities with a total area of 90,000 square feet, but requires a minimum of 400,000 square feet for exhibition, storage, and scholarly research;

(5) the bringing together of the Heye Museum collection and the Native American collection of the Smithsonian Institution would—

(C) provide facilities for scholarly meetings and the performing arts;

(D) make available curatorial and other learning opportunities for Indians; and

(9) identification of the origins of such human remains is essential to addressing that concern; and

(10) an extraordinary site on the National Mall in the District of Columbia (U.S. Government Reservation No. 6) is reserved for the use of the Smithsonian Institution and is available for construction of the National Museum of the American Indian.

Its mission is to advance knowledge and understanding of Native American cultures, including art, history, language, and the contributions Native Americans have made to our society.

“(6) The National Museum of the American Indian is an extraordinary site and an ideal location to establish a National Native American Veterans’ Memorial.

“(7) A National Native American Veterans’ Memorial would further the purposes of the National Museum of the American Indian by giving all Americans the opportunity to learn of the proud and courageous tradition of service of Native Americans in the Armed Forces of the United States.

“SEC. 3. AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH MEMORIAL.

A report in detail of the expenses on account of the National Zoological Park shall be made to Congress at the beginning of each regular session.

REORGANIZATION PLAN NO. 4 OF 1966

Eff.
Aug. 23, 1966, 31 F.R. 11137, 80 Stat. 1611

Prepared by the President and transmitted to the Senate and the House of Representatives in Congress assembled, June 13, 1966, pursuant to the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 203, as amended [see 5 U.S.C. 901 et seq.].

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK BUILDINGS AND BRIDGES

All those functions of the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia which were vested in the municipal architect of the District of Columbia by the provisions of the Act of August 24, 1912, c. 355, 37 Stat. 437 (20 U.S.C. 84; D.C. Code [former] §8–134), in respect of buildings of the National Zoological Park, and all functions of that Board which were vested in the engineer of bridges of the District of Columbia by those provisions in respect of bridges of the National Zoological Park, are hereby transferred to the Smithsonian Institution.

Message of the President

To the Congress of the United States:

I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1966, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended, and providing for a reorganization relating to the National Zoological Park located in the District of Columbia.

Today, all responsibilities for the administration of the park are vested in the Smithsonian Institution with one exception—the function of preparing plans and specifications for the construction of buildings and bridges at the zoo.
That statutory responsibility is now conducted by the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia [now the Mayor].

Under the accompanying reorganization plan, the responsibility for the preparation of these plans and specifications would be transferred from the District of Columbia Board of Commissioners to the Smithsonian.
The complete administration of the park would then be vested in one agency—the Smithsonian Institution.
This will allow the more efficient and effective development and management of the park.

In 1912, the functions to be transferred were vested in the Municipal Architect of the District of Columbia and in the Engineers of the Bridges of the District of Columbia.
In 1952, they were transferred to the Board of Commissioners.

When the 1912 act was passed, the District of Columbia shared the costs of capital improvements in the National Zoological Park.
In 1961, it ceased sharing these costs, and the Federal Government assumed complete responsibility for financing the improvements.
Accordingly, the District government retains no capital improvement responsibilities for the National Zoological Park except those functions relating to construction plans and specifications for buildings and bridges, as specified in the 1912 statute.
Upon the transfer of these remaining functions to the Smithsonian Institution, the administration of the National Zoological Park will, at last, be fully centered in one agency.
It is not practicable at this time, however, to itemize the resulting reduction in expenditures.

I have found, after investigation, that each reorganization included in the accompanying reorganization plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.

I recommend that the Congress allow the reorganization plan to become effective.

§102. Application of appropriations

The Secretary of Education is authorized to pay over semiannually, to the trustees of the American Printing House for the Blind, located in Louisville, Kentucky, and chartered in 1858 by the Legislature of Kentucky, upon requisition of their president, countersigned by their treasurer, one-half of such annual appropriation upon the following conditions:

(1) Purposes and methods of expenditures

First. (A) Such appropriation shall be expended by the trustees of the American Printing House for the Blind each year in manufacturing and furnishing books and other materials specially adapted for instruction of the blind; and the total amount of such books and other materials so manufactured and furnished by such appropriation shall each year be distributed among all the public and private nonprofit institutions in the States, Territories, and possessions of the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia, in which blind pupils are educated.
Each public and private nonprofit institution for the education of the blind shall receive, in books and other materials, upon requisition of its superintendent, that portion of the appropriation as is shown by the ratio between the number of blind pupils in that institution and the total number of blind pupils in all of the public and private nonprofit institutions in which blind pupils are educated.
Each chief State school officer shall receive, in books and other materials, upon requisition, that portion of the appropriation as is shown by the ratio between the number of blind pupils in public and private nonprofit institutions (in the State) in which blind pupils are educated, other than institutions to which the preceding sentence is applicable, and the total number of blind pupils in the public and private nonprofit institutions in which blind pupils are educated in all of the States, Territories, and possessions of the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia.
The ratio referred to in each of the two immediately preceding sentences shall be computed upon the first Monday in January of each year; and for purposes of such sentences the number of blind pupils in public and private nonprofit institutions in which blind pupils are educated shall be authenticated in such manner and as often as the trustees of the American Printing House for the Blind shall require.
For purposes of sections 101, 102, and 104 of this title, an institution for the education of the blind is any institution which provides education exclusively for the blind, or exclusively for the blind and other handicapped children (in which case special classes are provided for the blind); the chief State school officer of a State is the superintendent of public elementary and secondary schools in such State or, if there is none, such other official as the Governor certifies to have comparable responsibility in the State; and a blind pupil is a blind individual pursuing a course of study in an institution of less than college grade.

(B) The portion of the appropriation received by each chief State school officer, in such books and other materials under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph which represents the number of blind pupils in private nonprofit institutions in such State in which blind pupils are educated shall be distributed among such institutions on the basis of the number of blind pupils in each such institution as compared to the total number of such pupils in all of the private nonprofit institutions in which blind pupils are educated in such State.

(C) All books and other materials furnished pursuant to sections 101, 102, and 104 of this title, and control and administration of their use, shall vest only in a public agency.
Such books and materials made available pursuant to sections 101, 102 and 104 of this title for use of teachers and blind pupils in any State, Territory, or possession of the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia in any school shall be limited to those books and materials which have been approved by an appropriate educational authority or agency of such State, Territory, possession, Commonwealth, or District, or any local educational authority thereof, for use, or are used, in a public elementary or secondary school therein.

(2) Buildings

Second.
No part of the appropriation shall be expended in the erection or leasing of buildings; but the trustees of the American Printing House for the Blind may use each year a reasonable sum of the annual appropriation for salaries and other expenses of experts and other staff to assist special committees which may be appointed in performance of their functions, and for expenses of such special committees.

(3) Sales of books and apparatus at cost

Third.
No profit shall be put on any books or tangible apparatus for the instruction of the blind manufactured or furnished by the trustees of said American Printing House for the Blind, located in Louisville, Kentucky; and the price put upon each article so manufactured or furnished shall only be its actual cost.

(4) Income withheld when not properly used

Fourth.
The Secretary of the Treasury of the United States shall have the authority to withhold the appropriation whenever he shall receive satisfactory proof that the trustees of said American Printing House for the Blind, located in Louisville, Kentucky, are not using the appropriation for the benefit of the blind in the public and private nonprofit institutions for the education of the blind in the United States.

(5) Bond of treasurer

Fifth.
Before any money be paid to the treasurer of the American Printing House for the Blind by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, the treasurer of the American Printing House for the Blind shall execute a bond, with two approved sureties, to the amount of $20,000, conditioned that the money so received shall be expended according to this law and all amendments thereto, which shall be held by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, and shall be renewed every two years.

(6) Ex officio trustees

Sixth.
The superintendent of each public institution for the education of the blind (or his designee) and the chief State school officer (or his designee), of each State and possession of the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia, shall each, ex officio, be a member of the Board of Trustees of the American Printing House for the Blind only for purposes of administering sections 101, 102 and 104 of this title.

For the purposes of providing blind persons with remunerative employment, enlarging the economic opportunities of the blind, and stimulating the blind to greater efforts in striving to make themselves self-supporting, blind persons licensed under the provisions of this chapter shall be authorized to operate vending facilities on any Federal property.

(b) Preferences regulations; justification for limitation on operation

In authorizing the operation of vending facilities on Federal property, priority shall be given to blind persons licensed by a State agency as provided in this chapter; and the Secretary, through the Commissioner, shall, after consultation with the Administrator of General Services and other heads of departments, agencies, or instrumentalities of the United States in control of the maintenance, operation, and protection of Federal property, prescribe regulations designed to assure that—

(1) the priority under this subsection is given to such licensed blind persons (including assignment of vending machine income pursuant to section 107d–3 of this title to achieve and protect such priority), and

(2) wherever feasible, one or more vending facilities are established on all Federal property to the extent that any such facility or facilities would not adversely affect the interests of the United States.

Any limitation on the placement or operation of a vending facility based on a finding that such placement or operation would adversely affect the interests of the United States shall be fully justified in writing to the Secretary, who shall determine whether such limitation is justified.
A determination made by the Secretary pursuant to this provision shall be binding on any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States affected by such determination.
The Secretary shall publish such determination, along with supporting documentation, in the Federal Register.

Codification

The content of Pub. L. 93–516, including provisions thereof which amended and enacted various sections of this chapter, were originally contained in H.R. 14225, 93rd Congress, Second Session, which was pocket-vetoed during the 31-day intrasession adjournment of the 93rd Congress for the Congressional elections in November, 1974. See 1974 Amendment note below.

Pursuant to an order of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (Kennedy v. Jones, D.C.D.C. 1976, 412 F.Supp. 353) H.R. 14225 was deemed to have become law without the approval of the President on Nov. 21, 1974, and was given the designation Pub. L. 93–651. Therefore, for purposes of codification, this chapter should be deemed to have been amended by Pub. L. 93–651, Nov. 21, 1974, 89 Stat. 2–3, in exactly the same manner as it was amended by Pub. L. 93–516.

Short Title of 1974 Amendment

Section 200 of title II of Pub. L. 93–516 provided that: “This title [enacting sections 107b–1 to 107b–3 and 107d–1 to 107d–4 of this title, amending this section, sections 107a, 107b, 107d, 107e of this title, and section 5108 of Title 5, Government Organization and Employees, repealing sections 107c and 107e–1 of this title, and enacting provisions set out as notes under this section and section 702 of Title 29, Labor] may be cited as the ‘Randolph-Sheppard Act Amendments of 1974’.”

An identical provision is in section 200 of Pub. L. 93–651. See Codification note above.

Short Title of 1954 Amendment

Section 1 of act Aug. 3, 1954, provided that: “This Act [enacting section 107e–1 of this title and amending this section and sections 107a, 107b, 107e, and 107f of this title and sections 31 to 41, 42, 49b, and 49g of Title 29, Labor] may be cited as the ‘Vocational Rehabilitation Amendments of 1954’.”

Short Title

Act June 20, 1936, ch. 638, 49 Stat. 1559, which enacted this chapter, is popularly known as the “Randolph-Sheppard Vending Stand Act”. It is also known as the “Randolph-Sheppard Act”.

Congressional Findings

Section 201 of Pub. L. 93–516 provided that: “The Congress finds—

“(1) after review of the operation of the blind vending stand program authorized under the Randolph-Sheppard Act of June 20, 1936 [this chapter], that the program has not developed, and has not been sustained, in the manner and spirit in which the Congress intended at the time of its enactment, and that, in fact, the growth of the program has been inhibited by a number of external forces;

“(2) that the potential exists for doubling the number of blind operators on Federal and other property under the Randolph-Sheppard program within the next five years, provided the obstacles to growth are removed, that legislative and administrative means exist to remove such obstacles, and that Congress should adopt legislation to that end; and

“(3) that at a minimum the following actions must be taken to insure the continued vitality and expansion of the Randolph-Sheppard program—

“(A) establish uniformity of treatment of blind vendors by all Federal departments, agencies, and instrumentalities,

“(B) establish guidelines for the operation of the program by State licensing agencies,

“(C) require coordination among the several entities with responsibility for the program,

“(D) establish a priority for vending facilities operated by blind vendors on Federal property,

“(E) establish administrative and judicial procedures under which fair treatment of blind vendors, State licensing agencies, and the Federal Government is assured,

“(F) require stronger administration and oversight functions in the Federal office carrying out the program, and

“(G) accomplish other legislative and administrative objectives which will permit the Randolph-Sheppard program to flourish.”

An identical provision is in section 201 of Pub. L. 93–651. See Codification note above.

Each such license shall be issued for an indefinite period but may be terminated by the State licensing agency if it is satisfied that the facility is not being operated in accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed by such licensing agency.
Such licenses shall be issued only to applicants who are blind within the meaning of section 107e of this title.

(c) Selection of location and type of facility

The State licensing agency designated by the Secretary is authorized, with the approval of the head of the department or agency in control of the maintenance, operation, and protection of the Federal property on which the facility is to be located but subject to regulations prescribed pursuant to section 107 of this title, to select a location for such facility and the type of facility to be provided.

Each such department, agency, or instrumentality shall provide notice to the appropriate State licensing agency of its plans for occupation, acquisition, renovation, or relocation of a building adequate to permit such State agency to determine whether such building includes a satisfactory site or sites for a vending facility.

(2) The provisions of paragraph (1) shall not apply (A) when the Secretary and the State licensing agency determine that the number of people using the property is or will be insufficient to support a vending facility, or (B) to any privately owned building, any part of which is leased by any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States and in which, (i) prior to the execution of such lease, the lessor or any of his tenants had in operation a restaurant or other food facility in a part of the building not included in such lease, and (ii) the operation of such a vending facility by a blind person would be in proximate and substantial direct competition with such restaurant or other food facility except that each such department, agency, and instrumentality shall make every effort to lease property in privately owned buildings capable of accommodating a vending facility.
