The definitions in clauses (2) and (9)–(17) reflect the adoption of terminology which, though undefined in the source statutes restated in this title, represent the closest practicable approximation of the ways in which the terms defined have been most commonly used.
Where established uses conflict, a choice has been made.

In clause (1), the definition of “Territory” in 32:4c is executed throughout this revised title by specific reference, where applicable, to the Territories, Puerto Rico, and the Canal Zone.

In clause (2), a definition of “National Guard” is inserted for clarity.

In clause (3)(A), the words “a land force” are substituted for 32:2. The National Defense Act of 1916, §117 (last 66 words), 39 Stat. 212, is not contained in 32:2. It is also omitted from the revised section as repealed by the act of February 28, 1925, ch. 374, §3, 43 Stat. 1081.

In clauses (3) and (4), the word “Army” is inserted to distinguish the organizations defined from their Air Force counterparts.

In clauses (3) and (5), the words “unless the context or subject matter otherwise requires—” and “as provided in this title”, in 32:4b, are omitted as surplusage.

In clauses (3)(B) and (5)(B), the words “has its officers appointed” are substituted for the word “officered”, in 32:4b.

In clauses (4) and (6), only that much of the description of the composition of the Army National Guard of the United States and the Air National Guard of the United States is used as is necessary to distinguish these reserve components, respectively, from the other reserve components.

In clause (5)(A), the words “an air force” are substituted for the words “for which Federal responsibility has been vested in the Secretary of the Air Force or the Department of the Air Force pursuant to law”, in 10:1835, and for 32:2 (less applicability to Army National Guard), to make the definition of “Air National Guard” parallel with the definition of “Army National Guard”, and to make explicit the intent of Congress in creating the Air National Guard, that the organized militia henceforth should consist of three mutually exhaustive classes comprising the Army, Air, and Naval militia.

In clause (8), words showing how enlisted members became such are inserted to make clear that enlistment is not the only method of becoming a member in an enlisted grade.

In clause (2), the term “armed forces” is defined for legislative convenience and is defined the same as that term is defined in section 101(4) of title 10, United States Code.

The definition in clause (18) reflects the adoption of terminology which, though undefined in the source statutes restated in this title, represents the closest practicable approximation of the ways in which the term has been commonly used.

The word “members” is substituted for the words “officers and enlisted men”. The word “Regular” is omitted, since the organization is now prescribed for the Army, and the Regular Army is only a personnel category.

Army Staff, see section 3031 et seq. of Title 10.

§104. Units: location; organization; command

(a) Each State or Territory and Puerto Rico may fix the location of the units and headquarters of its National Guard.

(b) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this title, the organization of the Army National Guard and the composition of its units shall be the same as those prescribed for the Army, subject, in time of peace, to such general exceptions as the Secretary of the Army may authorize; and the organization of the Air National Guard and the composition of its units shall be the same as those prescribed for the Air Force, subject, in time of peace, to such general exceptions as the Secretary of the Air Force may authorize.

(c) To secure a force the units of which when combined will form complete higher tactical units, the President may designate the units of the National Guard, by branch of the Army or organization of the Air Force, to be maintained in each State and Territory, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia.
However, no change in the branch, organization, or allotment of a unit located entirely within a State may be made without the approval of its governor.

(d) To maintain appropriate organization and to assist in training and instruction, the President may assign the National Guard to divisions, wings, and other tactical units, and may detail commissioned officers of the National Guard or of the Regular Army or the Regular Air Force, as the case may be, to command those units.
However, the commanding officer of a unit organized wholly within a State or Territory, Puerto Rico, or the District of Columbia may not be displaced under this subsection.

(e) To insure prompt mobilization of the National Guard in time of war or other emergency, the President may, in time of peace, detail a commissioned officer of the Regular Army to perform the duties of chief of staff for each fully organized division of the Army National Guard, and a commissioned officer of the Regular Air Force to perform the duties of the corresponding position for each fully organized wing of the Air National Guard.

(f) Unless the President consents—

(1) an organization of the National Guard whose members have received compensation from the United States as members of the National Guard may not be disbanded; and

(2) the actual strength of such an organization in commissioned officers or enlisted members may not be reduced below the minimum strength prescribed by the President.

In subsection (a), the words “within their respective borders” are omitted as surplusage.

In subsection (b), the word “Army” is substituted for the words “Regular Army”, since the Army is the category for which the organization is prescribed, and the Regular Army is a personnel category for which no organization is prescribed.
Similarly, the words “Air Force” are used instead of the words “Regular Air Force”.

In subsection (c), the words “by branch of the Army or organization of the Air Force” are substituted for the words “as to branch or arm of service”. The words “branch, organization, or allotment of a unit” are substituted for the words “allotment, branch, or arm of units or organizations”.

In subsections (d) and (e) the word “commissioned” is inserted, since 32:8 and 10 historically applied only to commissioned officers (see opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAGA 1953/4078, 6 May 1953)).

In subsection (d), the word “brigades” is omitted as surplusage.

In subsection (e), the word “tactical” is omitted as surplusage.

A, title V, §522, Nov. 30, 1993, 107 Stat. 1655, directed Secretary of Defense to provide for a study of State and Federal missions of National Guard to be carried out by a federally funded research and development center, including consideration of both separate and integrated requirements (including requirements pertaining to personnel, weapons, equipment, and facilities) that derive from those missions, required an interim report not later than May 1, 1994, and a final report not later than Nov. 15, 1994, directed Secretary to submit each report to Congress, not later than 15 days after the date on which it is received by the Secretary, and directed Secretary, together with Secretary of the Army and Secretary of the Air Force, to conduct evaluation of assumptions, analysis, findings, and recommendations of the study and, not later than Feb. 1, 1995, to submit to Congress a report on the evaluation.

The First Corps Cadets is hereby declared to be entitled to a lieutenant colonel in command and a major second in command; and those officers, when federally recognized, are entitled to the pay provided by law for their respective grades: Provided, That nothing in this section or other provisions of law shall be considered to be in derogation of any other ancient privileges to which the First Corps Cadets is entitled under the laws, customs, or usages of the State of Massachusetts.”

The appropriation shall be reimbursed in full, out of appropriations available for paying those costs, for the amounts paid.
Appropriations available for paying those costs shall be available for making the reimbursements.

(C) To ensure that the use of units and personnel of the National Guard of a State pursuant to a State drug interdiction and counter-drug activities plan does not degrade the training and readiness of such units and personnel, the following requirements shall apply in determining the drug interdiction and counter-drug activities that units and personnel of the National Guard of a State may perform:

The Secretary of the Air Force shall prescribe regulations for accounting for property issued by the United States to the Air National Guard and for the fixing of responsibility for that property.
So far as practicable, regulations prescribed under this section shall be uniform among the components of each service.

(c) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned under subsection (b), liability for the value of property issued by the United States to the National Guard that is lost, damaged, or destroyed may be charged (1) to a member of the Army National Guard or the Air National Guard when in similar circumstances a member of the Army or Air Force serving on active duty would be so charged, or (2) to a State or Territory, Puerto Rico, or the District of Columbia when the property is lost, damaged, or destroyed incident to duty directed pursuant to the laws of, and in support of the authorities of, such jurisdiction.
Liability charged to a member of the Army National Guard or the Air National Guard shall be paid out of pay due to the member for duties performed as a member of the National Guard, unless the Secretary concerned shall for good cause remit or cancel that liability.
Liability charged to a State or Territory, Puerto Rico, or the District of Columbia shall be paid from its funds or from any other non-Federal funds.

(d) If property surveyed under this section is found to be unserviceable or unsuitable, the Secretary concerned or his designated representative shall direct its disposition by sale or otherwise.
The proceeds of the following under this subsection shall be deposited in the Treasury under section 4(b)(22) of the Permanent Appropriation Repeal Act, 1934.

(1) A sale.

(2) A stoppage against a member of the National Guard.

(3) A collection from a person, or from a State or Territory, Puerto Rico, or the District of Columbia, to reimburse the United States for the loss or destruction of, or damage to, the property.

(e) If a State or Territory, Puerto Rico, or the District of Columbia, whichever is concerned, neglects or refuses to pay for the loss or destruction of, or damage to, property charged against it under subsection (c), the Secretary concerned may bar it from receiving any part of appropriations for the Army National Guard or the Air National Guard, as the case may be, until the payment is made.

(f)(1) Instead of the procedure prescribed by subsections (b), (c), and (d), property issued to the National Guard that becomes unserviceable through fair wear and tear in service may, under regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary concerned, be sold or otherwise disposed of after an inspection, and a finding of unserviceability because of that wear and tear, by a commissioned officer designated by the Secretary.
The State or Territory, Puerto Rico, or the District of Columbia, whichever is concerned, is relieved of accountability for that property.

(2) In designating an officer to conduct inspections and make findings for purposes of paragraph (1), the Secretary concerned shall designate—

(A) in the case of the Army National Guard, a commissioned officer of the Regular Army or a commissioned officer of the Army National Guard who is also a commissioned officer of the Army National Guard of the United States; and
