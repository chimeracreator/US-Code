§1. Establishment of Coast Guard

The Coast Guard, established January 28, 1915, shall be a military service and a branch of the armed forces of the United States at all times.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 496; Pub. L. 94–546, §1(1), Oct. 18, 1976, 90 Stat. 2519; Pub. L. 107–296, title XVII, §1704(a), Nov. 25, 2002, 116 Stat. 2314; Pub. L. 112–213, title II, §217(1), Dec. 20, 2012, 126 Stat. 1555.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §1 (Jan. 28, 1915, ch. 20, §1, 38 Stat. 800; July 11, 1941, ch. 290, §§5, 6(a), 55 Stat. 585).

Said section has been divided.
Provisions relating to operation under the Navy in time of war are placed in sections 3 and 4 of this title, and the remainder is in this section.

This section continues the Coast Guard as a military service and branch of the armed forces of the United States at all times.
By the act of July 11, 1941, 55 Stat. 585 (title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §1), the Coast Guard was constituted a branch of the land and naval forces of the United States at all times.
This section therefore merely continues an existing agency and codifies existing law on the military status of the Coast Guard, substituting “armed forces” for “land and naval forces” because of the recent establishment of the Department of the Air Force as an “armed force” rather than as a part of the “land and naval forces”. The Coast Guard is designated a service in the Treasury Department except when operating as a service in the Navy.
This is a better definition of the status of the Coast Guard than one which defines it as a service under the Treasury Department in time of peace, because the President is authorized to place the Coast Guard under the Navy in time of emergency, which could be in time of peace.

Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

Short Title of 2012 Amendment

Pub. L. 112–213, §1(a), Dec. 20, 2012, 126 Stat. 1540, provided that: “This Act [see Tables for classification] may be cited as the ‘Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2012’.”

Historical and Revision Notes

This section defines in general terms, for the first time in any statute, all the primary duties of the Coast Guard.
It is derived from title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§45, 50k–50o, 51, 52, 53, 55, 60, 61, 62, 63, 98a, 104, 261, 301, title 33, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§720, 720a, 740, 740a, 740b, title 46, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§1 (footnote), 2 (R.S. 1536, 2747, 2758, 2759, 4249; June 23, 1874, ch. 455, §1, 18 Stat. 220; June 18, 1878, ch. 265, §4, 20 Stat. 163; July 5, 1884, ch. 221, §2, 23 Stat. 118; Feb. 14, 1903, ch. 552, §10, 32 Stat. 829; Apr. 19, 1906, ch. 1640, §§1–3, 34 Stat. 123; May 12, 1906, ch. 2454, 34 Stat. 190; June 17, 1910, ch. 301, §§6, 7, 36 Stat. 538; Mar. 4, 1913, ch. 141, §1, 37 Stat. 736; June 24, 1914, ch. 124, 38 Stat. 387; Mar. 3, 1915, ch. 81, §5, 38 Stat. 927; Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 1820; May 22, 1926, ch. 371, §6, 44 Stat. 626; June 30, 1932, ch. 314, §501, 47 Stat. 415; May 27, 1936, ch. 463, §1, 49 Stat. 1380; Aug. 16, 1937, ch. 665, §3, 50 Stat. 667; Feb. 19, 1941, ch. 8, §§2, 201, 55 Stat. 9, 11; July 11, 1941, ch. 290, §7, 55 Stat. 585; Nov. 23, 1942, ch. 639, §2(2), 56 Stat. 102; Sept. 30, 1944, ch. 453, §1, 58 Stat. 759; June 22, 1948, ch. 600, 62 Stat. 574; June 26, 1948, ch. 672, 62 Stat. 1050).

This section contains a codification of functions.
It sets forth in general language the primary responsibilities of the Coast Guard: enforcement of all Federal laws on waters to which they have application, safety of life and property at sea, aiding navigation, and readiness to function with the Navy.
Having been created in 1915 by the consolidation of the Revenue Cutter Service and the Life Saving Service, the Coast Guard has gradually been given additional duties and responsibilities, such as the assignment of law enforcement powers on the high seas and navigable waters in 1936, the transfer of the Lighthouse Service in 1939, and the transfer of the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation in 1942. Existing along with these other duties has been that of maintaining a state of readiness as a specialized service prepared for active participation with the Navy in time of war.
These various interdependent functions of the Service have not been expressed collectively in any statute heretofore, but it is believed desirable to do so in this revision in order to have outlined in general terms in one section the broad scope of the functions of the Coast Guard. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

Transfer of Functions

For transfer of authorities, functions, personnel, and assets of the Coast Guard, including the authorities and functions of the Secretary of Transportation relating thereto, to the Department of Homeland Security, and for treatment of related references, see sections 468(b), 551(d), 552(d), and 557 of Title 6, Domestic Security, and the Department of Homeland Security Reorganization Plan of November 25, 2002, as modified, set out as a note under section 542 of Title 6.

While operating as a service in the Navy, the Coast Guard shall be subject to the orders of the Secretary of the Navy, who may order changes in Coast Guard operations to render them uniform, to the extent such Secretary deems advisable, with Navy operations.

(c) Operation as a Service in the Navy.—Whenever the Coast Guard operates as a service in the Navy—

Historical and Revision Notes

This section grants broad general powers concerning policy matters to the Secretary.
Many of the powers are contained in existing law but some are enlarged and some additional powers are added as explained following.

Subsection (a) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §95 (Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601). Said section has been divided.
The provision authorizing the Secretary to man stations seems more appropriately given to the operational head of the Service, the Commandant, and for that reason is incorporated in section 93(c) of this title.

Subsection (b) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§28, 42 (Aug. 16, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601; July 3, 1926, ch. 742, §11, 44 Stat. 817). These sections were rewritten in order to broaden existing authority in regard to the training of Coast Guard personnel at schools of the other armed forces, thus approaching a practice of war time, and making for economy in the training of Service personnel; such training would be on a basis mutually satisfactory to the Secretaries involved.

Subsection (c) is based on R.S. 4242 and on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§29, 93, 94, 98a (R.S. 4245, 4249; May 4, 1882, ch. 117, §2, 22 Stat. 56; Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601; June 6, 1940, ch. 257, §4, 54 Stat. 247; Aug. 6, 1947, ch. 502, 61 Stat. 786). This subsection broadens existing law in that it provides general legislative authority for the construction and disposal of shore establishments of all types including aviation stations.

Subsection (d) is based in part on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§55, 57, 69, 109, and in part on title 31, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§487, 720, (R.S. 2748, 3618, 3692; June 18, 1878, ch. 265, §3, 20 Stat. 163; Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601). This subsection broadens existing law in that it provides general legislative authority for the design, construction, acquisition by other means, and disposal of vessels.

Subsection (e) is new.
It is derived from title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §31b (June 6, 1941, ch. 177, 55 Stat. 247 [which was originally repealed by act June 30, 1949, ch. 288, title VI, §602(a)(28), 63 Stat. 399, renumbered Sept. 5, 1950, ch. 849, §6(a), (b), 64 Stat. 583]) which provides for the exchange of vehicles, planes, and engines; similar authority in relation to vessels, is granted to the Secretary by this subsection and should prove advantageous to the Government.

Subsection (f) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §96 and on title 33, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§729, 730, 731 (Mar. 3, 1875, ch. 130, §1, 18 Stat. 372; Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 299, 35 Stat. 972; June 17, 1910, ch. 301, §9, 36 Stat. 538; Mar. 4, 1913, ch. 168, 37 Stat. 1018). This subsection broadens the power of the Secretary to receive as a gift or purchase sites for stations, to include the acquisition of land by any means provided it is for the purpose of executing duties and functions of the Coast Guard.

Subsection (g) is based in part on title 33, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §732 (Aug. 28, 1916, ch. 414, §2, 39 Stat. 538; July 11, 1941, ch. 290, §1, 55 Stat. 584) and grants authority to the Secretary to exchange interests in land as payment or part payment for other interests in land for the purpose of executing the duties and functions of the Coast Guard; this authority, on the basis of past experience, will prove advantageous to the Government.

Subsection (h) is new and merely insures that the Secretary may exercise any of the powers granted to the Commandant in this title.

Subsection (i) is based in part on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§51, 131 (R.S. 2756, 2758) and insures that the Secretary may do anything necessary to carry out the purposes of this title.

Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

“(a) In General.—Whenever the transfer of ownership of a Coast Guard vessel or aircraft to an eligible entity for use for educational, cultural, historical, charitable, recreational, or other public purposes is authorized by law or declared excess by the Commandant, the Coast Guard shall transfer the vessel or aircraft to the General Services Administration for conveyance to the eligible entity.

“(b) Conditions of Conveyance.—The General Services Administration may not convey a vessel or aircraft to an eligible entity as authorized by law unless the eligible entity agrees—

“(1) to provide the documentation needed by the General Services Administration to process a request for aircraft or vessels under section 102.37.225 of title 41, Code of Federal Regulations;

“(a) Findings.—The Congress finds the following:

“(1) The Great Lakes are home to more than 400 lighthouses.
One hundred and twenty of these maritime landmarks are in the State of Michigan.

“(2) Lighthouses are an important part of Great Lakes culture and stand as a testament to the importance of shipping in the region's political, economic, and social history.

“(3) Advances in navigation technology have made many Great Lakes lighthouses obsolete.
In Michigan alone, approximately 70 lighthouses will be designated as excess property of the Federal Government and will be transferred to the General Services Administration for disposal.

“(4) Unfortunately, the Federal property disposal process is confusing, complicated, and not well-suited to disposal of historic lighthouses or to facilitate transfers to nonprofit organizations.
This is especially troubling because, in many cases, local nonprofit historical organizations have dedicated tremendous resources to preserving and maintaining Great Lakes lighthouses.

“(5) If Great Lakes lighthouses disappear, the public will be unaware of an important chapter in Great Lakes history.

“(6) The National Trust for Historic Preservation has placed Michigan lighthouses on their list of Most Endangered Historic Places.

“(b) Assistance for Great Lakes Lighthouse Preservation Efforts.—The Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, may—

“(1) continue to offer advice and technical assistance to organizations in the Great Lakes region that are dedicated to lighthouse stewardship; and

“(b) Commercial VHF communication equipment placed on real property under the administrative control of the Coast Guard under this section shall not interfere in any manner with any current or future Coast Guard communication equipment.

“(c) Nothing in this section shall affect the rights or obligations of the United States under section 704(c) of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 [Pub. L. 104–104] (47 U.S.C. 332 note) with respect to the availability of property or under section 359(d) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 357(d)) with respect to charges for transmission of distress messages.”

Historical and Revision Notes

This section grants powers to the Commandant concerning, in general, operations within the Service and the internal functioning of the Service.
Many of the powers are contained in existing law, but some are enlarged, and some additional powers are added as explained following.

Subsection (a) is derived from title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §53, and title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §471 (R.S. 1536). The authority to order vessels to cruise along the coasts should be in the operational head of the Service, and not in the President.
This section is changed to cover adequately the necessary present day cruising and patrolling.

Subsection (b) is derived from R.S. 4242 and title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§29, 93, 94, 95, 97, 98a (R.S. 4245, 4249; May 4, 1882, ch. 117, §§2, 3, 22 Stat. 56; Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601; Aug. 6, 1947, ch. 502, 61 Stat. 786; June 6, 1940, ch. 257, §4, 54 Stat. 247), and specifically grants to the Commandant authority in regard to the establishment, discontinuance, and change of Coast Guard shore establishments other than Coast Guard districts.
This power must exist inherently in order for the Service to function efficiently.

Subsection (c) is derived from title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§54, 97, 112 (May 4, 1882, ch. 117, §3, 22 Stat. 56; May 30, 1908, ch. 231, 35 Stat. 553; Apr. 21, 1910, ch. 182, §2, 36 Stat. 326), and specifically grants to the Commandant authority in regard to the assignment of vessels, vehicles, aids to navigation, and other equipment.
This power is inherent to the proper functioning of any Service.

Subsection (d) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §91 (June 18, 1878, ch. 265, §7, 20 Stat. 164; June 10, 1921, ch. 18, §304, 42 Stat. 24; July 3, 1926, ch. 742, §9, 44 Stat. 817). Said section has been divided.
The part dealing with investigation of plans and inventions is covered in this subsection in broader terms, and the other parts are covered in general terms in section 632 of this title.

Subsection (e) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §111 (June 18, 1878, ch. 265, §9, 20 Stat. 164). This section has been rewritten to broaden the authority to include any investigation or study that may be of assistance to the Coast Guard, the limitation as to investigation of shipwrecks having been eliminated.

Subsection (f) is new and is intended to give legislative recognition to the importance of disseminating information by the Coast Guard for the promotion of safety at sea, life-saving techniques, and other Coast Guard activities.

Subsection (g) is new and provides for the training of Coast Guard personnel at other than schools or institutions of the other armed forces.
Such training is essential and has been carried on under the authority of appropriation acts for many years.

Subsection (h) is based in part on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§69, 108, 109, (R.S. 2748; June 20, 1874, ch. 344, §9, 18 Stat. 127; June 18, 1878, ch. 265, §3, 20 Stat. 163), and is intended to complement the authority granted to the Secretary in sec. 92(d) of this title granting similar authority to the Commandant as to smaller craft.

Subsection (i) is based in part on title 14, U.S.C., §§108, 109, and on title 33, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §752 (June 20, 1874, ch. 344, §9, 18 Stat. 127; June 18, 1878, ch. 265, §3, 20 Stat. 163; Mar. 4, 1913, ch. 168, 37 Stat. 10183, and grants power to the Commandant to acquire and dispose of various equipment and supplies.
The authority with respect to the acceptance of such equipment as a gift is new.

Subsection (j) is new and grants power to the Commandant to operate and maintain shore establishments; previously such authority has been inferred from statutes providing for the establishment of shore stations; again such authority is inherent to the functioning of any Service, and this section will provide no greater authority than has been exercised in the past.

Subsection (k) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §31b (June 6, 1941, ch. 177, 55 Stat. 247 [which was originally repealed by act June 30, 1949, ch. 288, title VI, §602(a)(28), 63 Stat. 399, renumbered Sept. 5, 1950, ch. 849, §6(a), (b), 64 Stat. 583]). The primary authority is granted to the Commandant as well as to the Secretary inasmuch as such exchange seems to be an operational matter and the items which may be exchanged have been enlarged by the addition of aids to navigation, appliances, equipment, and supplies.

Inasmuch as the act cited above applies to the Navy as well as the Coast Guard it is not scheduled for repeal but is being amended by section 13 of this act to eliminate reference to the Coast Guard.

Subsection (l) is new and is deemed desirable in order to give legislative authority for existing yards, and for the procurement of needed equipment and material in case such is not normally or economically obtainable from private contractors.

Subsection (m) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§110, 192 (June 20, 1874, ch. 344, §6, 18 Stat. 127; June 18, 1878, ch. 265, §10, 20 Stat. 165; July 3, 1926, ch. 742, §9, 44 Stat. 817). The power to accept volunteer services is enlarged to include all services offered in time of emergency, to save life or protect property, and the restrictive provisions relating to lifeboat stations only have been eliminated.

Subsection (n) is new and grants authority to the Commandant to lease real property under the control of the Coast Guard, when not immediately needed in Coast Guard operations.
Such authority will be advantageous to the Government, on the basis of past experience.

Subsection (o) is new and is supplementary to subsection (n) of this section.
It grants further authority to the Commandant permitting him to grant minor interests in land which is under control of the Coast Guard.
This will avoid the necessity of special acts of Congress in each of such instances.

Subsection (p) is new and is necessary to give proper authority for the maintenance of networks of wires and cables, in some cases over or along private property or public highways.
These networks are in existence at the present time and are essential for the Service to carry out its functions.

Subsection (q) is new and is necessary in order to provide clear authority for the maintenance of radio stations which are essential to Coast Guard functions.

Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

Historical and Revision Notes

This section is based in part on title 33, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §756 (Mar. 3, 1915, ch. 81, §6, 38 Stat. 928), and authorizes the Coast Guard to use its personnel and facilities to assist other Government agencies when requested and, correlatively, authorizes the Coast Guard to utilize the personnel and facilities of other agencies.
It is believed desirable to have this authority spelled out by statute because in times of emergency, for example floods, it sometimes becomes most advantageous to cooperate in this manner. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

Medical Emergency Helicopter Transportation Services to Civilians; Authorization to Coast Guard Commandant

Pub. L. 95–61, §8, July 1, 1977, 91 Stat. 260, which authorized Coast Guard to assist Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in providing medical emergency helicopter services to civilians, if assistance was provided in areas of regular Coast Guard unit assignment, did not interfere with Coast Guard mission, or increase required Coast Guard operating funds, and further providing that no individual (or his estate) operating within scope of his duties under this section's program would be civilly liable for damage caused incident thereto, was repealed and reenacted as section 147a of this title by Pub. L. 97–295, §§2(6)(A), 6(b), Oct. 12, 1982, 96 Stat. 1301, 1314.

§142. State Department

The Coast Guard, through the Secretary, may exchange information, through the Secretary of State, with foreign governments and suggest to the Secretary of State international collaboration and conferences on all matters dealing with the safety of life and property at sea, other than radio communication.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 505.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Because of the numerous situations in which it is necessary for the Coast Guard to deal with foreign governments, particularly in the field of safety of life and property at sea, the Coast Guard and the State Department agree that a provision such as this is desirable.

The international character of many Coast Guard functions makes it more and more necessary for the Service to be an initiating or participating agency in international collaboration.
Examples of international meetings concerned with matters affecting the Coast Guard include those which dealt with the International Rules of the Road, international load lines, the International Code of Signals, safety at sea, and international telecommunications.
It is highly desirable that there be a clear-cut legislative expression of Coast Guard cooperation with the State Department on proposed international conferences dealing with various phases of Coast Guard activities, such as aids to navigation, life-saving equipment, navigation and communication equipment other than radio communication, regulation of dangerous cargoes, international rules of the road, safety requirements and equipment of transoceanic aircraft and vessels, and safe manning standards and efficiency of personnel employed on transoceanic aircraft and vessels.
Provisions for similar relationship between the Civil Aeronautical Board and the State Department appear in the act of June 23, 1938, as amended, 52 Stat. 984 (title 49, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§425(c), 602). 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§143. Treasury Department

Commissioned, warrant, and petty officers of the Coast Guard are deemed to be officers of the customs and when so acting shall, insofar as performance of the duties relating to customs laws are concerned, be subject to regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury governing officers of the customs.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 506.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 19, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§1401(l), 1709(b) (Aug. 5, 1935, ch. 435, title II, §201, 49 Stat. 521; Aug. 5, 1935, ch. 438, title IV, §401, 49 Stat. 529).

This section will not repeal the sections cited above, but makes further provision that Coast Guard personnel when acting as officers of the customs shall, insofar as enforcing customs laws are concerned, be subject to regulations governing regular officers of the customs. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§144. Department of the Army and Department of the Air Force

(a) The Secretary of the Army or the Secretary of the Air Force at the request of the Secretary may, with or without reimbursement for the cost thereof, as agreed, receive members of the Coast Guard for instruction in any school, including any aviation school, maintained by the Army or the Air Force, and such members shall be subject to the regulations governing such schools.

(b) Officers and enlisted men of the Coast Guard shall be permitted to purchase quartermaster supplies from the Army at the same price as is charged the officers and enlisted men of the Army.

(c) Articles of ordnance property may be sold by the Secretary of the Army to officers of the Coast Guard for their use in the public service in the same manner as these articles are sold to officers of the Army.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 506; Pub. L. 94–546, §1(10), Oct. 18, 1976, 90 Stat. 2519; Pub. L. 98–557, §15(a)(3)(D), Oct. 30, 1984, 98 Stat. 2865.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Subsection (a) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §28 (Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601). Section has been enlarged to include the Air Force as well as the Army, and to include all schools maintained by the Army or Air Force, rather than aviation schools only.
Reimbursement is made optional depending upon agreement of the Secretaries.

Subsection (b) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §31 (Mar. 6, 1920, ch. 94, §1, 41 Stat. 506).

Subsection (c) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §31a (Mar. 3, 1909, ch. 252, 35 Stat. 751; Apr. 15, 1937, ch. 101, 50 Stat. 65).

Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§145. Navy Department

(b) Officers and enlisted men of the Coast Guard shall be permitted to purchase quartermaster supplies from the Navy and the Marine Corps at the same price as is charged the officers and enlisted men of the Navy and Marine Corps.

(c) When the Coast Guard is operating in the Department of Homeland Security, the Secretary shall provide for such peacetime training and planning of reserve strength and facilities as is necessary to insure an organized, manned, and equipped Coast Guard when it is required for wartime operation in the Navy.
To this end, the Secretary of the Navy for the Navy, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, for the Coast Guard, may from time to time exchange such information, make available to each other such personnel, vessels, facilities, and equipment, and agree to undertake such assignments and functions for each other as they may agree are necessary and advisable.

(d)(1) As part of the services provided by the Secretary of the Navy pursuant to subsection (a)(4), the Secretary may provide support services to chaplain-led programs to assist members of the Coast Guard on active duty and their dependents, and members of the reserve component in an active status and their dependents, in building and maintaining a strong family structure.

(2) In this subsection, the term “support services” include transportation, food, lodging, child care, supplies, fees, and training materials for members of the Coast Guard on active duty and their dependents, and members of the reserve component in an active status and their dependents, while participating in programs referred to in paragraph (1), including participation at retreats and conferences.

(3) In this subsection, the term “dependents” has the same meaning as defined in section 1072(2) of title 10.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 506; Aug. 3, 1950, ch. 536, §3, 64 Stat. 406; Pub. L. 94–546, §1(11), Oct. 18, 1976, 90 Stat. 2519; Pub. L. 98–557, §15(a)(3)(D), Oct. 30, 1984, 98 Stat. 2865; Pub.

Historical and Revision Notes

Subsection (a) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§28, 42, 57 (Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601; July 3, 1926, ch. 742, §11, 44 Stat. 817.) Subsection is enlarged to make reimbursement for the building of ships or the training of personnel dependent on agreement of the Secretaries, and to include all schools operated by the Navy, rather than aviation schools only.

Subsection (b) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §31 (Mar. 6, 1920, ch. 94, §1, 41 Stat. 506).

Subsection (c) is new.
This subsection enacts what has been the practice of the Navy and Coast Guard in keeping the Coast Guard trained to “come on board with some muscle” in time of emergency.

Section 3 of this title deals with the relationship of the Coast Guard to the Navy Department.
This section deals with cooperation with the Navy.
Whereas the status of the Coast Guard in time of war was treated in chapter 1 of this title, this section has application in time of peace when the Coast Guard is not under the Navy Department.

Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§146. United States Postal Service

Coast Guard facilities and personnel may be utilized for the transportation and delivery of mail matter during emergency conditions or at isolated locations under such arrangements as may be satisfactory to the Secretary and the United States Postal Service.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 506; Pub. L. 94–546, §1(12), Oct. 18, 1976, 90 Stat. 2519; Pub. L. 99–640, §10(a)(5), Nov. 10, 1986, 100 Stat. 3549.)

Historical and Revision Notes

This section provides generally for what has been the practice between the Coast Guard and the Post Office Department in Alaska for years.
The authorization is limited to emergency conditions or isolated locations. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§147. Department of Commerce

In order to promote the safety of life and property on and over the high seas and waters over which the United States has jurisdiction, and to facilitate the preparation and dissemination by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the weather reports, forecasts, and warnings essential to the safe and efficient conduct of domestic and international commerce on and over such seas and waters, the Commandant may cooperate with the Administrator, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration by procuring, maintaining, and making available, facilities and assistance for observing, investigating, and communicating weather phenomena and for disseminating weather data, forecasts and warnings, the mutually satisfactory terms of such cooperation in weather service to be agreed upon and arranged between the Commandant and the Administrator, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 507; Pub. L. 94–546, §1(13), Oct. 18, 1976, 90 Stat. 2520; Pub. L. 97–295, §2(5), Oct. 12, 1982, 96 Stat. 1301.)

Historical and Revision Notes

This section outlines the sphere of cooperation between the Weather Bureau and the Coast Guard.
It would not permit any cooperation that has not been carried on in the past.

Although the Coast Guard has always cooperated closely with the Weather Bureau, positive recognition of this has never appeared in the statutes.
In its patrol, its aiding navigation, and its life saving activities, the Coast Guard finds it important to make, receive and transmit weather observations and measurements.
Furthermore, with the advent of war, weather reporting, particularly mid-Atlantic weather patrol work, assumed increasing importance, and this extensive weather station manning in cooperation with the Weather Bureau must be provided for in the postwar period.
This section providing for such close cooperation with the Weather Bureau in weather reporting would crystallize the cooperative practices of the two agencies as they have operated for years. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§147a. Department of Health and Human Services

(a) The Commandant may assist the Secretary of Health and Human Services in providing medical emergency helicopter transportation services to civilians.
The Commandant may prescribe conditions, including reimbursement, under which resources may be provided under this section.
The following specific limitations apply to assistance provided under this section:

(1) Assistance may be provided only in areas where Coast Guard units able to provide the assistance are regularly assigned.
Coast Guard units may not be transferred from one area to another to provide the assistance.

(2) Assistance may be provided only to the extent it does not interfere with the performance of the Coast Guard mission.

(3) Providing assistance may not cause an increase in amounts required for the operation of the Coast Guard.

(b) An individual (or the estate of that individual) who is authorized by the Coast Guard to provide a service under a program established under subsection (a) and who is acting within the scope of that individual's duties is not liable for injury to, or loss of, property or personal injury or death that may be caused incident to providing the service.

In subsection (a), the words “Secretary of Health and Human Services” are substituted for “Department of Health, Education, and Welfare” because of 20:3508(b) and because the responsibility is in the head of the Department.
The word “may” is substituted for “is authorized to” for clarity.
The word “conditions” is substituted for “terms and conditions” because it is inclusive.

(2) An activity may not be conducted under this subsection with a foreign country unless the Secretary of State approves the conduct of such activity in that foreign country.

(3) The amount of funds used under this subsection may not exceed $100,000 in any fiscal year.

Historical and Revision Notes

Derived from title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §441a (May 19, 1926, ch. 334, 44 Stat. 565; May 14, 1935, ch. 109, 49 Stat. 218; Oct. 1, 1942, ch. 571, 56 Stat. 763; 1946 Proc.
No. 2695, July 4, 1946, 11 F.R. 7517, 60 Stat. 1352).

Experience has indicated that it will be advantageous for the Government to include the Coast Guard along with the other armed forces for the purpose of detailing personnel for service with foreign governments.

It seems probable that the increased collaboration with foreign governments after the war and the vital nature of the Coast Guard's activities in relation to such collaboration will result in requests from time to time by foreign governments for assistance which the Coast Guard is in the best position to render.
This section, which confers broad authority in the President to detail Coast Guard officers and enlisted men to assist foreign governments, is patterned after the act of October 1, 1942, 56 Stat. 763 (title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §441–a), which authorizes the President to detail Army, Navy, and Marine Corps officers and men to certain foreign governments and, in times of war or national emergency, to any foreign government in the interests of national defense. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

Delegation of Authority

Authority of President under this section as invoked by section 2 of Ex. Ord.
No. 13223, Sept. 14, 2001, 66 F.R. 48201, as amended, delegated to Secretary of Homeland Security by section 5 of Ex. Ord.
No. 13223, set out as a note under section 12302 of Title 10, Armed Forces.

§150. Coast Guard officers as attachés to missions

Commissioned officers may, with the consent of the Secretary of State, be regularly and officially attached to the diplomatic missions of the United States in those nations with which the United States is extensively engaged in maritime commerce.
Expenses for the maintenance of such Coast Guard attachés abroad, including office rental and pay of employees and allowances for living quarters, including heat, fuel, and light, may be defrayed by the Coast Guard.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 507.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Experience since the war has indicated the necessity for making provision for the assignment of Coast Guard officers to diplomatic missions in those foreign countries which are extensively engaged in maritime commerce with the United States.
This is largely the result of duties in connection with inspection of merchant vessels.

This section authorizes the designation, with the consent of the State Department, of Coast Guard officers to be officially attached to diplomatic missions of the United States.
Although Coast Guard advice on Coast Guard matters is always available to our diplomatic missions, in those locations where such advice and information are frequently sought, it is felt that the most effective utilization of Coast Guard services would be achieved by having Coast Guard officers attached to such missions.
Provision for customs officers to be attached to diplomatic missions is contained in the act of March 4, 1923, as amended, 42 Stat. 1453 (title 19, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §6). Before the transfer in 1939 of the Foreign Agriculture Service to the State Department, representatives of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics of the Department of Agriculture stationed abroad were agricultural attachés. Act of June 5, 1930, 46 Stat. 498 (title 7, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §542(a)). 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§151. Contracts with Government-owned establishments for work and material

(a) In General.—All orders or contracts for work or material, under authorization of law, placed with Government-owned establishments by the Coast Guard, shall be considered as obligations in the same manner as provided for similar orders or contracts placed with private contractors, and appropriations for such work or material shall remain available for payment therefor as in the case of orders or contracts placed with private contractors.

(b) Orders and Agreements for Industrial Activities.—Under this section, the Coast Guard industrial activities may accept orders from and enter into reimbursable agreements with establishments, agencies, and departments of the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security.

§181. Administration of Academy

The immediate government and military command of the Coast Guard Academy shall be in the Superintendent of the Academy, subject to the direction of the Commandant under the general supervision of the Secretary.
The Commandant may select a superintendent from the active list of the Coast Guard who shall serve in the pleasure of the Commandant.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 508.)

Historical and Revision Notes

This section does not change the present method of administration of the Academy.
It makes statutory what has been administrative regulation heretofore, and it is believed highly desirable to make the control of an institution of such national interest as the Academy the subject of a statute.

This section is new.
There is no provision in existing law which establishes the Academy and sets it up as an operating unit.
Nor is there any provision which creates the office of Superintendent of the Academy, or prescribes his duties and functions.
Heretofore this has been accomplished by regulations, and the laws which deal with the Academy assume its existence as a going institution and assume the existence of the Superintendent with certain defined functions and duties.
This section continues the Academy as previously established, provides for the appointment of the Superintendent by the Commandant, and defines in general terms his functions.
The Academy would thus be placed on a definite statutory basis, and the office of Superintendent would be a statutory position, but the present administration of the Academy would in no way be interfered with. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§181a. Cadet applicants; preappointment travel to Academy

The Secretary is authorized to expend appropriated funds for selective preappointment travel to the Academy for orientation visits of cadet applicants.

(Added Pub. L. 98–557, §24(a), Oct. 30, 1984, 98 Stat. 2872.)

§182. Cadets; number, appointment, obligation to serve

(a) The number of cadets appointed annually to the Academy shall be as determined by the Secretary but the number appointed in any one year shall not exceed six hundred.
Appointments to cadetships shall be made under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, who shall determine age limits, methods of selection of applicants, term of service as a cadet before graduation, and all other matters affecting such appointments.
In the administration of this chapter, the Secretary shall take such action as may be necessary and appropriate to insure that female individuals shall be eligible for appointment and admission to the Coast Guard Academy, and that the relevant standards required for appointment, admission, training, graduation, and commissioning of female individuals shall be the same as those required for male individuals, except for those minimum essential adjustments in such standards required because of physiological differences between male and female individuals.
The Secretary may summarily dismiss from the Coast Guard any cadet who, during his cadetship, is found unsatisfactory in either studies or conduct, or may be deemed not adapted for a career in the Coast Guard.
Cadets shall be subject to rules governing discipline prescribed by the Commandant.

(b) Each cadet shall sign an agreement with respect to the cadet's length of service in the Coast Guard.
The agreement shall provide that the cadet agrees to the following:

(1) That the cadet will complete the course of instruction at the Coast Guard Academy.

(2) That upon graduation from the Coast Guard Academy the cadet—

(A) will accept an appointment, if tendered, as a commissioned officer of the Coast Guard; and

(B) will serve on active duty for at least five years immediately after such appointment.

(3) That if an appointment described in paragraph (2) is not tendered or if the cadet is permitted to resign as a regular officer before the completion of the commissioned service obligation of the cadet, the cadet—

(A) will accept an appointment as a commissioned officer in the Coast Guard Reserve; and

(B) will remain in that reserve component until completion of the commissioned service obligation of the cadet.

(c)(1) The Secretary may transfer to the Coast Guard Reserve, and may order to active duty for such period of time as the Secretary prescribes (but not to exceed four years), a cadet who breaches an agreement under subsection (b). The period of time for which a cadet is ordered to active duty under this paragraph may be determined without regard to section 651(a) of title 10.

(2) A cadet who is transferred to the Coast Guard Reserve under paragraph (1) shall be transferred in an appropriate enlisted grade or rating, as determined by the Secretary.

(3) For the purposes of paragraph (1), a cadet shall be considered to have breached an agreement under subsection (b) if the cadet is separated from the Coast Guard Academy under circumstances which the Secretary determines constitute a breach by the cadet of the cadet's agreement to complete the course of instruction at the Coast Guard Academy and accept an appointment as a commissioned officer upon graduation from the Coast Guard Academy.

(d) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations to carry out this section.
Those regulations shall include—

(1) standards for determining what constitutes, for the purpose of subsection (c), a breach of an agreement under subsection (b);

(2) procedures for determining whether such a breach has occurred; and

(3) standards for determining the period of time for which a person may be ordered to serve on active duty under subsection (c).

(e) In this section, “commissioned service obligation”, with respect to an officer who is a graduate of the Academy, means the period beginning on the date of the officer's appointment as a commissioned officer and ending on the sixth anniversary of such appointment or, at the discretion of the Secretary, any later date up to the eighth anniversary of such appointment.

(f)(1) This section does not apply to a cadet who is not a citizen or national of the United States.

(2) In the case of a cadet who is a minor and who has parents or a guardian, the cadet may sign the agreement required by subsection (b) only with the consent of the parent or guardian.

(g) A cadet or former cadet who does not fulfill the terms of the obligation to serve as specified under section (b), or the alternative obligation imposed under subsection (c), shall be subject to the repayment provisions of section 303a(e) of title 37.

Section 15 of title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., has been divided.
That part dealing with clothing allowance for cadets is placed in section 183 of this title and the other parts are incorporated with the proviso of title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §15a–1 to form this section.

Section 15a–1 of title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., has been divided.
That part dealing with the appointment of cadets to the grade of ensign is placed in section 185 of this title, and the proviso is placed in this section.

The length of term of service as a cadet prior to graduation is added to the list of matters specifically determined by the Secretary.

The period of required service after graduation is increased from 3 to 4 years, to attain uniformity with the other service academies. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

Savings Provision

For savings provision relating to payment or repayment of any bonus, incentive pay, special pay, or similar pay obligated to be paid before Apr. 1, 2006, under a provision of this section amended by section 687(d) of Pub. L. 109–163, see section 687(f) of Pub. L. 109–163, set out as a note under section 510 of Title 10, Armed Forces.

§183. Cadets; initial clothing allowance

The Secretary may prescribe a sum which shall be credited to each new cadet upon first admission to the Academy, to cover the cost of his initial clothing and equipment issue, which sum shall be deducted subsequently from his pay.
Each cadet discharged prior to graduation who is indebted to the United States on account of advances of pay to purchase required clothing and equipment shall be required to turn in to the Academy all clothing and equipment of a distinctively military nature to the extent required to discharge such indebtedness; and, if the value of such clothing and equipment so turned in does not cover the indebtedness incurred, then such indebtedness shall be canceled.

§184. Cadets; degree of bachelor of science

The Superintendent of the Academy may, under such rules and regulations as the Secretary shall prescribe, confer the degree of bachelor of science upon all graduates of the Academy and may, in addition, confer the degree of bachelor of science upon such other living graduates of the Academy as shall have met the requirements of the Academy for such degree.

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §15a (May 25, 1933, ch. 37, 48 Stat. 73; July 8, 1937, ch. 447, 50 Stat. 477; Aug. 9, 1946, ch. 928, 60 Stat. 961).

Changes in phraseology were made inasmuch as the Academy is now accredited by the Association of American Universities.
It was not so accredited when the section was enacted.

Inasmuch as the acts cited above apply equally to the Military Academy and the Naval Academy, as well as the Coast Guard Academy, they are not scheduled for repeal but are being amended by section 13 of this act to eliminate reference to the Coast Guard. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§185. Cadets; appointment as ensign

The President may, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, appoint as ensigns in the Coast Guard all cadets who shall graduate from the Academy.
Ensigns so commissioned on the same date shall take rank according to their proficiency as shown by the order of their merit at date of graduation.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 508.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §15a–1 (May 25, 1943, ch. 99, 57 Stat. 84).

Said section has been divided.
The proviso is incorporated in section 182 of this title.
The other part is incorporated in this section.

The last sentence of this section is new as a statute; it makes statutory what has been the practice of years, and is similar to the third sentence of title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §1057, applicable to graduates of the Naval Academy. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§186. Civilian teaching staff

(a) The Secretary may appoint in the Coast Guard such number of civilian faculty members at the Academy as the needs of the Service may require.
They shall have such titles and perform duties as prescribed by the Secretary.
Leaves of absence and hours of work for civilian faculty members shall be governed by regulations promulgated by the Secretary, without regard to the provisions of title 5.

(b) The compensation of persons employed under this section is as prescribed by the Secretary.

Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §15d (Apr. 16, 1937, ch. 107, §3, 50 Stat. 67; May 2, 1942, ch. 273, 56 Stat. 265).

The last sentence is new and is inserted to permit adjustment of the work load and leave schedule of Academy faculty members due to the peculiarity of the academic schedule.

The last sentence of this section is new, being included in order to allow for adjusting the working time and leave of civilian instructors in conformity with the academic terms at the Academy.
The work load of an instructor varies greatly, and flexibility in administration of a faculty is therefore essential.
The leave provided for civil service employees does not fit the needs of an instruction staff, and this has been a source of difficulty in the past.
This new provision would permit leave during the summer and between academic terms without deduction from pay, and, it is contemplated, at no other time.

Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§187. Permanent commissioned teaching staff; composition

The permanent commissioned teaching staff at the Academy shall consist of professors, associate professors, assistant professors and instructors, in such numbers as the needs of the Service require.
They shall perform duties as prescribed by the Commandant, and exercise command only in the academic department of the Academy.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 509; Pub. L. 86–474, §1(10), May 14, 1960, 74 Stat. 145.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§15b, 15c (Apr. 16, 1937, ch. 107, §§1, 2, 50 Stat. 66; May 2, 1942, ch. 273, 56 Stat. 265).

Section 15b of title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., has been divided.
Part of the provisions of the first sentence is placed in this section, while other provisions are placed in section 188 of this title.

Section 15c of title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., has been divided.
The last sentence is incorporated in this section, while the other provisions are placed in section 189 of this title.

The composition of the teaching staff at the Academy is changed materially on the recommendation of the Academic Board and the Advisory Committee.
The scope of duty of members of the staff is enlarged to include whatever the Commandant prescribes.

Title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §15b provides for five professors as heads or assistant heads of departments at the Academy.
The Academic Board of the Academy and the Advisory Committee, after extensive study have recommended the change, as provided in this section, to three professors and twelve others on the permanent teaching staff, with designations to conform generally with the designations and grades of faculty members at other universities.
The librarian is given faculty status because of the role of the library as the center of the modern university; this is in conformity with the practice of other higher educational institutions.
It is believed that the increased number of permanent commissioned instructors is justified and desirable in view of the expansion of the Cadet Corps as the full effect of the return to a four-year course is felt.
It is probable that, in the next few years, the number of cadets will approximate 450. The average number in the past two years has been about 300. This new set-up for the permanent commissioned teaching staff will permit desirable exchanges of professors with leading universities, and occasional sabbatical leaves in order to better the faculty generally.
It is pointed out that this increase in permanent instructors does not increase the authorized number of officers in the Coast Guard, as they are all included in the limitation provided in section 42 of this title.
If a teaching position at the Academy is not provided for permanently it will require the assignment of an additional regular officer, so it is apparent that the changes proposed in this section do not increase the size of the Service, or the expense, but represent a long-range plan to better the Academy as a leading educational institution within the present, recognized, standards for a proper university faculty.
The last sentence retains the command status of the professors as provided in existing law but enlarges the field in which they may perform duty, in order to make it possible to give them interim assignments other than at the Academy, thus broadening their knowledge of the Service while still advantageously utilizing their services. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§188. Appointment of permanent commissioned teaching staff

The President may appoint in the Coast Guard, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, the professors, associate professors, assistant professors, and instructors who are to serve on the permanent commissioned teaching staff of the Academy.
An original appointment to the permanent commissioned teaching staff, unless the appointee has served as a civilian member of the teaching staff, regular commissioned officer, temporary commissioned officer, or reserve commissioned officer in the Coast Guard, shall be a temporary appointment until the appointee has satisfactorily completed a probationary term of four years of service; thereafter he may be regularly appointed and his rank shall date from the date of his temporary appointment in the grade in which permanently appointed.

Said section has been divided.
That part of the first sentence which provides for the composition of the teaching staff is incorporated in section 187 of this title.
The other provisions are incorporated in this section, except for the proviso which has been omitted as no longer needed.

This section incorporates the following changes because of the new plan for the permanent teaching staff: the President is authorized to appoint a candidate to any of the grades prescribed; and the probationary term, applicable unless the candidate has served in the Coast Guard as prescribed in this section, is increased from two to four years.
Authorization for appointment in any grade is deemed desirable in order to permit the acquisition of outstanding instructors for the staff.
It is believed that the former two-year period was too short to fully evaluate the capabilities of a temporary appointee. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§189. Grade of permanent commissioned teaching staff

Professors shall be commissioned officers with grade not above captain, associate and assistant professors with grade not above commander, and instructors with grade not above lieutenant commander.
All officers of the permanent commissioned teaching staff shall receive the pay and allowances of other commissioned officers of the same grade and length of service.
When any such professor, associate professor, assistant professor, or instructor is appointed or commissioned with grade less than the highest grade permitted, he shall be promoted under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 509; Pub. L. 86–474, §1(12), May 14, 1960, 74 Stat. 145.)

Said section has been divided.
The last sentence is incorporated in section 187 of this title.
The other provisions are incorporated in this section.

The limitation on grade of professors is raised from Commander to Captain, and other limitations as to grades within the new permanent commissioned teaching staff are established.

This section prescribes the relative ranks for the various grades in the permanent commissioned teaching staff, establishes the pay as heretofore, and provides for promotion as the Secretary shall prescribe. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§190. Retirement of permanent commissioned teaching staff

Professors, associate professors, assistant professors, and instructors in the Coast Guard shall be subject to retirement or discharge from active service for any cause on the same basis as other commissioned officers of the Coast Guard, except that they shall not be required to retire from active service under the provisions of section 288 of this title, nor shall they be subject to the provisions of section 289 of this title, nor shall they be required to retire at age sixty-two but may be permitted to serve until age sixty-four at which time unless earlier retired or separated they shall be retired.
The Secretary may retire any member of the permanent commissioned teaching staff who has completed thirty years’ active service.
Service as a civilian member of the teaching staff at the Academy in addition to creditable service authorized by any other law in any of the military services rendered prior to an appointment as a professor, associate professor, assistant professor, or instructor shall be credited in computing length of service for retirement purposes.
The provisions of law relating to retirement for disability in line of duty shall not apply in the case of a professor, associate professor, assistant professor, or instructor serving under a temporary appointment.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 509; Pub. L. 86–474, §1(13), May 14, 1960, 74 Stat. 145; Pub. L. 88–130, §1(8), Sept. 24, 1963, 77 Stat. 175; Pub. L. 89–444, §1(10), June 9, 1966, 80 Stat. 196; Pub. L. 91–278, §1(5), June 12, 1970, 84 Stat. 304.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §15f (Apr. 16, 1937, ch. 107, §5, 50 Stat. 67).

The provision prohibiting the retirement of a professor because of physical disability with less than 15 years’ service is changed to have application only during the temporary appointment of a professor.

This section provides for the retirement of associate professors, assistant professors, and commissioned instructors in addition to professors.
It is believed that the provision of existing law requiring 15 years’ service before becoming eligible for retirement, discriminated against this group of officers as no other group was discriminated against, and should be eliminated.
It was changed so that these officers would be ineligible for retirement during their probationary term only.

Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§191. Credit for service as member of civilian teaching staff

Service as a member of the civilian teaching staff at the Academy in addition to creditable services authorized by any other law in any of the military services rendered prior to an appointment as professor, associate professor, assistant professor, or instructor shall be credited in computing length of service as a professor, associate professor, assistant professor, or instructor for purposes of pay and allowances.

Historical and Revision Notes

This chapter, dealing with the appointment, enlistment, promotion, retirement and recall of all military personnel, covers subject matter which has been greatly affected by war-time legislation and, therefore, has required rather extensive rewriting of existing law in order to correlate all of the various provisions.
An attempt has been made to provide for enlisted men and warrant officers in a manner similar to the way that commissioned officers are provided for; for example, the act of February 21, 1946, ch. 34, 60 Stat. 29 (title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §162a), made provision for the retirement of commissioned officers on half pay after twenty years naval service, and a prewar statute provided for twenty year retirement of enlisted men on half pay.
This leaves warrant officers the only military group not eligible for retirement in twenty years, and a provision such as found in section 305 of this title, granting such retirement, seems clearly indicated in order to avoid unjust discrimination.

The subject matter seemed to break down into the sub-heads of “Commissioned Officers”, “Warrant Officers”, “Enlisted Men”, and “General Provisions”. Each of the first three sub-heads parallels the other two, insofar as the applicability of statutes of the three groups permits.
The last sub-head includes the broad provisions which, in the same terms, can be made applicable to all military personnel.
In accord with existing Navy and Coast Guard law, the term “commissioned officer” includes commissioned warrant officers unless specifically excepted, or manifestly inapplicable.
Heretofore Coast Guard statutes have designated commissioned warrant officers as chief warrant officers; in line with Navy designation it is changed to commissioned warrant officers throughout this title.
Terms such as “Coast Guard personnel” or “personnel of the Coast Guard”, as used throughout this title, are intended to include all employees of the Service, civilian and military. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

Year-End Strength for Active Duty Personnel and Average Military Training Student Loads for Each Fiscal Year After Fiscal Year 1977; Authorization and Appropriations

Pub. L. 94–406, §6, Sept. 10, 1976, 90 Stat. 1236, which had required that Congress set the active duty end strength and average training student loads for each fiscal year for the Coast Guard, appropriations for those years not to be spent relating to those areas until Congress made such determination, was repealed and reenacted as section 661 of this title by Pub. L. 97–295, §§2(20)(A), 6(b), Oct. 12, 1982, 96 Stat. 1302, 1314.

a. appointments

§211. Original appointment of permanent commissioned officers

(a)(1) The President may appoint permanent commissioned officers in the Regular Coast Guard in grades appropriate to their qualification, experience, and length of service, as the needs of the Coast Guard may require, from among the following categories:

(A) Graduates of the Coast Guard Academy.

(B) Commissioned warrant officers, warrant officers, and enlisted members of the Regular Coast Guard.

(C) Members of the Coast Guard Reserve who have served at least 2 years as such.

(D) Licensed officers of the United States merchant marine who have served 2 or more years aboard a vessel of the United States in the capacity of a licensed officer.

(2) Original appointments under this section in the grades of lieutenant commander and above shall be made by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.

(3) Original appointments under this section in the grades of ensign through lieutenant shall be made by the President alone.

Appointees whose dates of commission are the same shall take precedence with each other as the Secretary shall determine.

However, the Secretary is not required to convene a board to recommend officers for promotion to a grade when no vacancies exist in the grade concerned, and he estimates that none will occur in the next twelve months.

(Added Pub. L. 88–130, §1(10)(C), Sept. 24, 1963, 77 Stat. 178.)

The promotion zone for each grade shall consist of the most senior officers of that grade on the active duty promotion list who are eligible for consideration for promotion to the next higher grade and who have not previously been placed in a promotion zone for selection for promotion to the next higher grade.
The number of officers in each zone shall be determined after considering—

(1) the needs of the service;

(2) the estimated numbers of vacancies available in future years to provide comparable opportunity for promotion of officers in successive year groups; and

(3) the extent to which current terms of service in that grade conform to a desirable career promotion pattern.

However, such number of officers shall not exceed the number to be selected for promotion divided by six-tenths.

(b) Promotion zones from which officers will be selected for promotion to the grade of rear admiral (lower half) shall be established by the Secretary as the needs of the service require.

§263. Special selection boards; correction of errors

(a) Officers Not Considered Due to Administrative Error.—

(1) In general.—If the Secretary determines that as the result of an administrative error—

(A) an officer or former officer was not considered for selection for promotion by a selection board convened under section 251; or

(B) the name of an officer or former officer was not placed on an all-fully-qualified-officers list;

the Secretary shall convene a special selection board to determine whether such officer or former officer should be recommended for promotion and such officer or former officer shall not be considered to have failed of selection for promotion prior to the consideration of the special selection board.

(2) Effect of failure to recommend for promotion.—If a special selection board convened under paragraph (1) does not recommend for promotion an officer or former officer, whose grade is below the grade of captain and whose name was referred to that board for consideration, the officer or former officer shall be considered to have failed of selection for promotion.

(b) Officers Considered But Not Selected; Material Error.—

(1) In general.—In the case of an officer or former officer who was eligible for promotion, was considered for selection for promotion by a selection board convened under section 251, and was not selected for promotion by that board, the Secretary may convene a special selection board to determine whether the officer or former officer should be recommended for promotion, if the Secretary determines that—

(A) an action of the selection board that considered the officer or former officer—

(i) was contrary to law in a matter material to the decision of the board; or

(ii) involved material error of fact or material administrative error; or

(B) the selection board that considered the officer or former officer did not have before it for consideration material information.

(2) Effect of failure to recommend for promotion.—If a special selection board convened under paragraph (1) does not recommend for promotion an officer or former officer, whose grade is that of commander or below and whose name was referred to that board for consideration, the officer or former officer shall be considered—

(A) to have failed of selection for promotion with respect to the board that considered the officer or former officer prior to the consideration of the special selection board; and

(B) to incur no additional failure of selection for promotion as a result of the action of the special selection board.

(c) Requirements for Special Selection Boards.—Each special selection board convened under this section shall—

(1) be composed in accordance with section 252 and the members of the board shall be required to swear the oaths described in section 254;

(2) consider the record of an applicable officer or former officer as that record, if corrected, would have appeared to the selection board that should have considered or did consider the officer or former officer prior to the consideration of the special selection board and that record shall be compared with a sampling of the records of—

(A) those officers of the same grade who were recommended for promotion by such prior selection board; and

(B) those officers of the same grade who were not recommended for promotion by such prior selection board; and

(3) submit to the Secretary a written report in a manner consistent with sections 260 and 261.

(d) Appointment of Officers Recommended for Promotion.—

(1) In general.—An officer or former officer whose name is placed on a promotion list as a result of the recommendation of a special selection board convened under this section shall be appointed, as soon as practicable, to the next higher grade in accordance with the law and policies that would have been applicable to the officer or former officer had the officer or former officer been recommended for promotion by the selection board that should have considered or did consider the officer or former officer prior to the consideration of the special selection board.

(2) Effect.—An officer or former officer who is promoted to the next higher grade as a result of the recommendation of a special selection board convened under this section shall have, upon such promotion, the same date of rank, the same effective date for the pay and allowances of that grade, and the same position on the active duty promotion list as the officer or former officer would have had if the officer or former officer had been recommended for promotion to that grade by the selection board that should have considered or did consider the officer or former officer prior to the consideration of the special selection board.

(3) Record correction.—If the report of a special selection board convened under this section, as approved by the President, recommends for promotion to the next higher grade an officer not eligible for promotion or a former officer whose name was referred to the board for consideration, the Secretary may act under section 1552 of title 10 to correct the military record of the officer or former officer to correct an error or remove an injustice resulting from the officer or former officer not being selected for promotion by the selection board that should have considered or did consider the officer or former officer prior to the consideration of the special selection board.

(e) Application Process and Time Limits.—The Secretary shall issue regulations regarding the process by which an officer or former officer may apply to have a matter considered by a special selection board convened under this section, including time limits related to such applications.

(f) Limitation of Other Jurisdiction.—No official or court of the United States shall have authority or jurisdiction over any claim based in any way on the failure of an officer or former officer to be selected for promotion by a selection board convened under section 251, until—

(1) the claim has been referred to a special selection board convened under this section and acted upon by that board; or

(2) the claim has been rejected by the Secretary without consideration by a special selection board convened under this section.

(g) Judicial Review.—

(1) In general.—A court of the United States may review—

(B) an action of a special selection board under this section to determine if the court finds that the action of the special selection board was contrary to law or involved material error of fact or material administrative error.

(2) Remand and reconsideration.—If, with respect to a review under paragraph (1), a court makes a finding described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of that paragraph, the court shall remand the case to the Secretary and the Secretary shall provide the applicable officer or former officer consideration by a new special selection board convened under this section.

(h) Designation of Boards.—The Secretary may designate a selection board convened under section 251 as a special selection board convened under this section.
A selection board so designated may function in the capacity of a selection board convened under section 251 and a special selection board convened under this section.

Any enlisted member on the retired list may, with his consent, be assigned to such duties as he may be able to perform, except that no enlisted member on the retired list who has reached the age of sixty-two years shall be recalled in time of peace.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 522; Aug. 3, 1950, ch. 536, §19, 64 Stat. 407; Pub. L. 98–557, §15(a)(3)(A), (4)(B)(i), Oct. 30, 1984, 98 Stat. 2865.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §185c (May 24, 1939, ch. 146, §4, 53 Stat. 755).

This section was changed so as to make provisions for enlisted men parallel to similar provisions for commissioned and warrant officers (see §§241 and 311 of the revised title). It seems fair and equitable that similar provisions should apply to all classes of personnel insofar as practicable. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§361. Relief of retired enlisted member promoted while on active duty

Any enlisted member on the retired list recalled to active duty who during such active duty is advanced to a higher grade or rating under a permanent or temporary appointment or promotion shall, upon relief from active duty be advanced on the retired list to the highest grade or rating held while on active duty.
In case the appointment or promotion was temporary the advancement on the retired list shall be made only to such grade or rating in which the member served satisfactorily on active duty.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 522; Aug. 3, 1950, ch. 536, §20, 64 Stat. 407; Pub. L. 98–557, §15(a)(3)(A), (G), (4)(C)(i), Oct. 30, 1984, 98 Stat. 2865.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Derived from title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§3501(a) and (b), 350j(b) (July 24, 1941, ch. 320, §10, 55 Stat. 605; Feb. 21, 1946, ch. 34, §8(a), 60 Stat. 28).

Said sections have application to officers only, but in accord with the general plan to make as many provisions as possible applicable both to officers and men, it seems highly desirable to provide similarly for enlisted men—a fortiori because there are cases in the Coast Guard in which enlisted men are suffering inequitably because there is no provision for advancing men on the retired list after they have been advanced in rating while serving on active duty after recall from the retired list. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§362. Retirement in cases where higher grade or rating has been held

Any enlisted member who is retired under any provision of section 353, 354, 355, or 357 of this title shall be retired from active service with the highest grade or rating held by him while on active duty in which, as determined by the Secretary, his performance of duty was satisfactory, but not lower than his permanent grade or rating.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 522; Aug. 3, 1950, ch. 536, §21, 64 Stat. 407; Pub. L. 97–295, §2(9), Oct. 12, 1982, 96 Stat. 1302; Pub. L. 98–557, §15(a)(3)(A), Oct. 30, 1984, 98 Stat. 2865; Pub. L. 99–348, title II, §205(b)(8), July 1, 1986, 100 Stat. 700.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §3501(e) (July 24, 1941, ch. 320, §10, 55 Stat. 605; Feb. 21, 1946, ch. 34, §8(a), 60 Stat. 28).

The requirement that the higher grade or rating be held prior to June 30, 1946, has been eliminated; this seems to be in line with the intent of Congress as expressed in section 303 of the act of June 29, 1948, ch. 708, 62 Stat. 1081. The act of July 24, 1941, 55 Stat. 605, was enacted primarily for application to Navy personnel but it is made applicable to Coast Guard personnel by its own terms (see title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §350j(b)). 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

See section 1207 of Title 10.

§365. Extension of enlistments

Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the term of enlistment of any enlisted member may, by voluntary written agreement, be extended and re-extended for a period not exceeding six full years from the date of expiration of the then-existing term of enlistment, and subsequent to such date an enlisted member who so extends his term of enlistment shall receive the same pay and allowances in all respects as though regularly discharged and reenlisted immediately upon expiration of his term of enlistment.
However, the total of all such extensions of an enlistment may not exceed six years.
No such extension shall operate to deprive the enlisted member concerned, upon discharge at the termination thereof, of any right, privilege, or benefit to which he would have been entitled if his term of enlistment had not been so extended.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 523; Pub. L. 86–474, §1(18), May 14, 1960, 74 Stat. 146; Pub. L. 98–557, §15(a)(3)(A), Oct. 30, 1984, 98 Stat. 2865.)

Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§366. Retention beyond term of enlistment in case of disability

Any enlisted member of the Coast Guard in the active service whose term of enlistment expires while he is suffering disease or injury incident to service and not due to misconduct, and who is in need of medical care or hospitalization, may, with his consent, be retained in such service beyond the expiration of his term of enlistment.
Any such enlisted member shall be entitled to receive at Government expense medical care or hospitalization and his pay and allowances, including credit for longevity, until he shall have recovered to such extent as would enable him to meet the physical requirements for reenlistment, or until it shall have been ascertained by competent authority of the Coast Guard that the disease or injury is of a character that recovery to such an extent would be impossible.
Any enlisted member whose enlistment is so extended shall be subject to forfeitures in the same manner and to the same extent as if his term of enlistment had not expired.
Nothing contained in this section shall prevent any enlisted member from being held in the service without his consent under section 367 of this title.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 523; Pub. L. 98–557, §15(a)(3)(A), Oct. 30, 1984, 98 Stat. 2865.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §35b (Dec. 12, 1941, ch. 566, 55 Stat. 797).

The parenthetical part, which has no application insofar as the Coast Guard is concerned, has been eliminated.

Inasmuch as the act cited above applies equally to the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps, as well as the Coast Guard, it is not scheduled for repeal but is being amended by section 14 of this act to eliminate reference to the Coast Guard.

Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§367. Detention beyond term of enlistment

Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, an enlisted member may be detained in the Coast Guard beyond the term of his enlistment:

(1) until the first arrival of the vessel on which he is serving at its permanent station, or at a port in a State of the United States or in the District of Columbia; or

(2) if attached to a shore station beyond the continental limits of the United States or in Alaska, until his first arrival at a port in any State of the United States or in the District of Columbia where his reenlistment or discharge may be effected, or until he can be discharged or reenlisted at his station beyond the continental limits of the United States or in Alaska, whichever is earlier, but in no event to exceed three months; or

(3) during a period of war or national emergency as proclaimed by the President, and, in the interest of national defense, for a period not to exceed six months after the end of the war or the termination of the emergency; or

(4) for a period of not exceeding thirty days in other cases whether or not specifically covered by this section, when essential to the public interests, and the determination that such detention is essential to the public interests, made in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, shall be final and conclusive.

Any member detained in the Coast Guard as provided in this section shall be entitled to receive pay and allowances and benefits under the same conditions as though his enlistment period had not expired, and shall be subject in all respects to the laws and regulations for the government of the Coast Guard until his discharge therefrom.
Enlisted members detained under the provisions of clause (1) shall be entitled to the pay and allowances provided for enlisted personnel of the Navy detained under similar circumstances.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 523; Aug. 3, 1950, ch. 536, §22, 64 Stat. 407; July 24, 1956, ch. 692, §§2(4), 3, 70 Stat. 631; Pub. L. 98–557, §§15(a)(3)(A), (C), 17(b)(4), Oct. 30, 1984, 98 Stat. 2865, 2868.)

§369. Inclusion of certain conditions in enlistment contract

The enlistment contract shall contain the substance of sections 365 to 368, inclusive, of this title.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 524.)

Historical and Revision Notes

It is believed desirable to have the provisions specified included in the enlistment contract, as they include certain privileges and obligations that any man should clearly understand before enlisting. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§370. Discharge within three months before expiration of enlistment

Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, any enlisted member may be discharged at any time within three months before the expiration of his term of enlistment or extended enlistment without prejudice to any right, privilege, or benefit that he would have received, except pay and allowances for the unexpired period not served, or to which he would thereafter become entitled, had he served his full term of enlistment or extended enlistment.

(Added June 8, 1955, ch. 136, §2, 69 Stat. 88; amended Pub. L. 98–557, §15(a)(3)(A), Oct. 30, 1984, 98 Stat. 2865.)

§371. Aviation cadets; procurement; transfer

(a) The grade of aviation cadet is established as a special enlisted grade in the Coast Guard.
Under such regulations as the Secretary prescribes, citizens in civil life may be enlisted as, and enlisted members of the Coast Guard with their consent may be designated as, aviation cadets.

(b) Except in time of war or national emergency declared by Congress, not less than 20 percent of the aviation cadets procured in each fiscal year shall be procured from qualified enlisted members of the Coast Guard.

(c) No persons may be enlisted or designated as an aviation cadet unless—

(1) the person agrees in writing that, upon successful completion of the course of training as an aviation cadet, the person will accept a commission as an ensign in the Coast Guard Reserve and will serve on active duty as such for at least three years, unless sooner released; and

(2) if under twenty-one years of age, the person has the consent of the person's parent or guardian to the agreement.

(d) Under such regulations as the Secretary prescribes, an aviation cadet may be transferred to another enlisted grade or rating in the Coast Guard, released from active duty, or discharged.

(Added Pub. L. 89–444, §1(20), June 9, 1966, 80 Stat. 196; amended Pub. L. 97–295, §2(11), Oct. 12, 1982, 96 Stat. 1302; Pub. L. 98–557, §15(a)(1), Oct. 30, 1984, 98 Stat. 2864.)

§372. Aviation cadets; benefits

Except as provided in section 402(c) of title 37, aviation cadets or their beneficiaries are entitled to the same allowances, pensions, gratuities, and other benefits as are provided for enlisted members in pay grade E–4. While on active duty, an aviation cadet is entitled to uniforms, clothing, and equipment at the expense of the United States.

(Added Pub. L. 89–444, §1(20), June 9, 1966, 80 Stat. 197.)

§373. Aviation cadets; appointment as Reserve officers

(a) An aviation cadet who fulfills the eligibility requirements of section 2003 of title 10 for designation as a naval aviator may be appointed an ensign in the Coast Guard Reserve and designated a Coast Guard aviator.

(b) Aviation cadets who complete their training at approximately the same time are considered for all purposes to have begun their commissioned service on the same date, and the decision of the Secretary in this regard is conclusive.

(Added Pub. L. 89–444, §1(20), June 9, 1966, 80 Stat. 197; amended Pub. L. 94–546, §1(28), Oct. 18, 1976, 90 Stat. 2521.)

§374. Critical skill training bonus

(a) The Secretary may provide a bonus, not to exceed $20,000, to an enlisted member who completes training in a skill designated as critical, if at least four years of obligated active service remain on the member's enlistment at the time the training is completed.
A bonus under this section may be paid in a single lump sum or in periodic installments.

(b) If an enlisted member voluntarily or because of misconduct does not complete the member's term of obligated active service, the Secretary may require the member to repay the United States, on a pro rata basis, all sums paid under this section.
The Secretary may charge interest on the amount repaid at a rate, to be determined quarterly, equal to 150 percent of the average of the yields on the 91-day Treasury bills auctioned during the calendar quarter preceding the date on which the amount to be repaid is determined.

(Added Pub. L. 108–293, title II, §204(a), Aug. 9, 2004, 118 Stat. 1032.)

GENERAL PROVISIONS

§421. Retirement

(a) Every commissioned officer, warrant officer, or enlisted member who is retired under any provisions of this title shall be retired with the permanent grade or rate held at the time of retirement, unless entitled to retire with a higher grade or rate under any provision of this title or any other law.

(b) Where an officer is entitled, under any provision of law, to retire with one grade higher than the grade in which serving at the time of retirement, the next higher grade in the case of captain shall be rear admiral (lower half), and the next higher grade in the case of commissioned warrant officer shall be lieutenant (junior grade).

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 524; Pub. L. 97–417, §2(10), Jan. 4, 1983, 96 Stat. 2086; Pub. L. 98–557, §15(a)(3)(A), Oct. 30, 1984, 98 Stat. 2865; Pub. L. 99–145, title V, §514(c)(1), Nov. 8, 1985, 99 Stat. 629; Pub. L. 99–348, title II, §205(b)(10), July 1, 1986, 100 Stat. 700.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Subsection (a) is new in this form, but the provision contained therein is expressed or implied in numerous statutes relating to the retirement of military personnel.

A provision defining the next higher grade to that of commissioned warrant officer as lieutenant (junior grade), for purposes of retirement, was added.

The other provisions of said section are obsolete and are no longer needed.

Subsection (a) is new, but the provision contained in it is expressed or implied in numerous statutes relating to retirement of military personnel.
It is believed desirable to include such a provision to prevent any misconstruction of retirement statutes, even though no change in existing law is intended on the point covered, either by other sections dealing with retirement or by this section.

Subsection (b) is a codification of the only provision of title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §174, that it is desired to retain, and in addition designated the next higher grade for commissioned warrant officers as lieutenant (junior grade) because the pay of the commissioned warrant officers is the same as for the grade of lieutenant (junior grade) and advancing such officers to the grade of ensign would in some aspects not appear to be a promotion. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§422. Status of recalled personnel

All retired personnel when recalled to active duty shall serve in the grade or rate in which they were serving at the time of retirement.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 524; Pub. L. 99–348, title II, §205(b)(10), July 1, 1986, 100 Stat. 700.)

Historical and Revision Notes

This provision is desirable because many enlisted men and low-ranking officers may now retire with higher grade which they previously held on a temporary basis.
If recalled in the higher grades, they might not be capable of holding same at the time of recall. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§423. Computation of retired pay

(a)(1) The retired pay of a member who first became a member of a uniformed service (as defined in section 101 of title 10) before September 8, 1980, is determined by multiplying—

(A) the sum of—

(i) the basic pay of the member's retired grade or rate, and

(ii) all permanent additions thereto including longevity credit to which the member was entitled at the time of retirement; by

(B) the retired pay multiplier determined under section 1409 of title 10 for the number of years of service that may be credited to the member under section 1405 of such title.

(2) In the case of an officer who served as Commandant of the Coast Guard, retired pay under paragraph (1) shall be computed at the highest rate of basic pay applicable to the officer while so serving.

(3) In the case of an enlisted member who served as the master chief petty officer of the Coast Guard, retired pay under paragraph (1) shall be computed at the highest rate of basic pay to which the member was entitled while so serving, if that basic pay is greater than the basic pay of the grade or rate to which the member is otherwise entitled at the time of retirement.

(4) In the case of an officer whose retired pay is computed on the pay of a grade for which basic pay is not based upon years of service, retired pay under paragraph (1) shall be computed on the basis of the number of years of service for which the officer would be entitled to credit in the computation of pay on the active list had the officer been serving in the grade of captain at the time of retirement.

(b) The retired pay of a member who first became a member of a uniformed service (as defined in section 101 of title 10) on or after September 8, 1980, is determined by multiplying—

(1) the retired pay base determined under section 1407 of title 10; by

(2) the retired pay multiplier determined under section 1409 of title 10 for the number of years of service that may be credited to the member under section 1405 of such title.

(c)(1) In computing for the purpose of subsection (a) or (b) the number of years of service that may be credited to a member under section 1405 of title 10—

(A) each full month of service that is in addition to the number of full years of service creditable to the member shall be counted as 1/12 of a year; and

(B) any remaining fractional part of a month shall be disregarded.

(2) Retired pay computed under this section, if not a multiple of $1, shall be rounded to the next lower multiple of $1.

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§162a, 167, 175c, 185d (Apr. 12, 1902, ch. 501, §9, 32 Stat. 101; Jan. 12, 1938, ch. 3, §3, 52 Stat. 5; May 24, 1939, ch. 146, §5, 53 Stat. 756; Feb. 21, 1946, ch. 34, §10, 60 Stat. 29).

Section was enlarged to include computation of retired pay in all situations.
It is in accord with the provisions of Navy statutes. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§424. Limitations on retirement and retired pay

(a) The provisions of any section of this title shall not be construed so as to prevent any member from being placed on the retired list with the highest grade or rate and the highest retired pay to which the member may be entitled under the provisions of any other section of this title or under any other law.

(b) In no case may the retired pay of a member exceed 75 percent of (1) the sum of the active-duty pay and all permanent additions thereto (including longevity credit to which the member is entitled) of the grade or rate on which the member's pay is computed, or (2) the retired pay base determined under section 1407 of title 10, as appropriate.

Historical and Revision Notes

The two provisions of this section are considered desirable as safeguards to eliminate any possible misconstruction of situations relating to retirement and retired pay in respect to the two points covered. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§424a. Suspension of payment of retired pay of members who are absent from the United States to avoid prosecution

Under procedures prescribed by the Secretary, the Secretary may suspend the payment of the retired pay of a member or former member during periods in which the member willfully remains outside the United States to avoid criminal prosecution or civil liability.
The procedures shall address the types of criminal offenses and civil proceedings for which the procedures may be used, including the offenses specified in section 8312 of title 5, and the manner by which a member, upon the return of the member to the United States, may obtain retired pay withheld during the member's absence.

(Added Pub. L. 107–295, title IV, §444(a), Nov. 25, 2002, 116 Stat. 2132.)

§425. Board for Correction of Military Records deadline

(a) Deadline for Completion of Action.—The Secretary shall complete processing of an application for correction of military records under section 1552 of title 10 by not later than 10 months after the date the Secretary receives the completed application.

(b) Remedies Deemed Exhausted.—Ten months after a complete application for correction of military records is received by the Board for Correction of Military Records of the Coast Guard, administrative remedies are deemed to have been exhausted, and—

(1) if the Board has rendered a recommended decision, its recommendation shall be final agency action and not subject to further review or approval within the department in which the Coast Guard is operating; or

(2) if the Board has not rendered a recommended decision, agency action is deemed to have been unreasonably delayed or withheld and the applicant is entitled to—

(A) an order under section 706(1) of title 5, directing final action be taken within 30 days from the date the order is entered; and

(B) from amounts appropriated to the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, the costs of obtaining the order, including a reasonable attorney's fee.

§427. Prohibition of certain involuntary administrative separations

(a) In General.—Except as provided in subsection (b), the Secretary may not authorize the involuntary administrative separation of a covered individual based on a determination that the covered individual is unsuitable for deployment or other assignment due to a medical condition of the covered individual considered by a Physical Evaluation Board during an evaluation of the covered individual that resulted in the covered individual being determined to be fit for duty.

(b) Reevaluation.—

(1) In general.—The Secretary may require a Physical Evaluation Board to reevaluate any covered individual if the Secretary determines there is reason to believe that a medical condition of the covered individual considered by a Physical Evaluation Board during an evaluation of the covered individual renders the covered individual unsuitable for continued duty.

(2) Retirements and separations.—A covered individual who is determined, based on a reevaluation under paragraph (1), to be unfit to perform the duties of the covered individual's office, grade, rank, or rating may be retired or separated for physical disability under this chapter.

§432. Personnel of former Lighthouse Service

(a) Any person of the former Lighthouse Service commissioned as an officer in the Coast Guard shall be an extra number in his grade and in the grades to which he may be promoted.
He shall take precedence (1) with other officers commissioned in his grade from the former Lighthouse Service as the Secretary of the Treasury may determine, and (2) with other line officers in his grade in accordance with the respective dates of their commissions in such grade.
He shall be eligible for promotion, if otherwise qualified, at such time as the officer in a regular number in line of promotion next above him on the seniority list becomes eligible for promotion; or if there be no such officer in his grade, he shall be eligible for promotion, if otherwise qualified, when a vacancy occurs in the next higher grade.
An officer so commissioned shall be assigned to duty for which he is specially qualified, and professional examinations for promotion given to such officer shall embrace only subjects which pertain to the duty to which he is assigned.

(b) Each vacancy (1) hereafter occurring in the extra numbers of such officers; (2) existing on August 5, 1939, in positions in the Lighthouse Service formerly held by personnel eligible for such commissions; and (3) created by the retirement, resignation, death, or separation from the service for any other cause, of such personnel who do not possess the qualifications prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury or who, being qualified, do not accept a commission thereunder, shall operate to increase by one the total authorized number of line officers of the Coast Guard.

(c) All persons of the former Lighthouse Service commissioned, appointed, or enlisted in the Coast Guard shall be subject to all laws and regulations for the government of the Coast Guard, and nothing contained in this title shall be construed to prevent the application to any of such persons of laws and regulations concerning the military discipline of commissioned and warrant officers and enlisted members of the Coast Guard.

(d) In computing length of service, for the purpose of retirement in the Coast Guard, of any person of the former Lighthouse Service commissioned, appointed, or enlisted in the Coast Guard, there shall be included all service computable for retirement under the provisions of section 763 of title 33; and after July 1, 1948, in computing longevity for the purpose of pay of such person there shall be included all service of such person in the Lighthouse Service.

(e) No person so commissioned, appointed, or enlisted in the Coast Guard shall suffer any reduction in the total of the annual compensation and allowances which he was receiving on the date of his commission, appointment, or enlistment.
Upon his retirement from active duty in the Coast Guard, the retired pay of any person so commissioned, appointed, or enlisted, shall not be less than an annuity computed in accordance with the provisions of section 763 of title 33, substituting, however, for purposes of such computation, the annual compensation which he was receiving on the date of his commission, appointment, or enlistment in the Coast Guard for the average annual pay received by him for the last five years of service.

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, chapter 51, subchapter III of chapter 53, and sections 5542–5546 of title 5 shall not apply to civilian keepers of lighthouses and to civilians employed on lightships and other vessels of the Coast Guard.

(g)(1) The head of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating under regulations prescribed by him, may regulate the hours of duty and the pay of civilian keepers of lighthouses and civilians employed on lightships and other vessels of the Coast Guard, but such personnel may be called upon for duty in emergency circumstances or otherwise at any time or all times.
The existing system governing the pay of such employees may be continued or changed except that overtime compensation, night differential, and extra pay for duty on holidays shall not be paid to such employees.
In lieu thereof additional annual compensation may be authorized, which may be prescribed either as a fixed differential or as a percentage of the basic compensation otherwise applicable to such employees.
In no case shall basic compensation exceed $15,000 per annum, except that nothing contained in this subsection shall operate to decrease the basic compensation of any person employed by the Coast Guard on the date of enactment of this subsection, and in no case shall additions thereto exceed 25 percent of such basic compensation.
Provision may be made for compensatory absence from duty when conditions of employment result in confinement because of isolation or in long periods of continuous duty; and provisions may likewise be made for extra allowance for service outside of the continental limits of the United States.

(2) The additional compensation authorized by this subsection shall be included in any computation of compensation under section 6 of the Act of June 20, 1918 (33 U.S.C. 763).

Historical and Revision Notes

Chapter 13 of this title deals with pay, allowances, awards, and other rights and benefits for personnel of the Coast Guard.
Some of these sections are new as applied to the Coast Guard, some clarify and consolidate existing law, and others merely restate existing law.
There is no intention to amend, enlarge or curtail the Pay Readjustment Act of 1942, as amended. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§461. Remission of indebtedness of enlisted members upon discharge

If he considers it in the best interest of the United States, the Secretary may have remitted or canceled any part of an enlisted member's indebtedness to the United States or any of its instrumentalities remaining unpaid before or at the time of, that member's honorable discharge.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 530; Sept. 3, 1954, ch. 1263, §33(b), 68 Stat. 1238; Pub. L. 87–526, §1(1), July 10, 1962, 76 Stat. 141; Pub. L. 87–649, §14d(7), Sept. 7, 1962, as added Pub. L. 89–718, §73(a)(3), Nov. 2, 1966, 80 Stat. 1124; Pub. L. 89–718, §73(c)(1), Nov. 2, 1966, 80 Stat. 1124; Pub. L. 90–83, §2, Sept. 11, 1967, 81 Stat. 220; Pub. L. 94–546, §1(29), Oct. 18, 1976, 90 Stat. 2521.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§20a, 121 (May 18, 1920, ch. 190, §8, 41 Stat. 603; June 10, 1922, ch. 212, 42 Stat. 625; July 3, 1926, ch. 742, §10, 44 Stat. 817).

Said section 121 was omitted from the 1940 and 1946 editions of the U.S. Code, but it has been held that the assimilation provision thereof is inoperative only insofar as Congress has made specific legislative provision for the Coast Guard, and that benefits derived from legislation pertaining to the Navy previously conferred upon the Coast Guard, and not provided for in subsequent legislation, survive to the Coast Guard under the assimilation statute. (See 27 Comp.
Dec. 234; 22 Comp.
Gen. 723; decision of June 9, 1947, B–63472; decision of April 2, 1948, B–70438; and decision of September 2, 1948, B–77295.)

It seems desirable to retain this assimilation provision as to pay in order to cover any failure to provide specifically for the Coast Guard in military pay legislation.

This section assimilates the pay of military personnel of the Coast Guard to the pay of military personnel of the Navy.
It seems that this is the most feasible method of insuring that the pay of military personnel of the Coast Guard will not vary from the pay of military personnel of the other armed forces.
The assimilation is intended to include authorization for extra pay and allowances as provided for personnel of the Navy, for all types of special duty: for example, qualified divers on diving duty, military personnel assigned to submarine duty, military personnel assigned to aviation duty, officers assigned as aides to flag officers, and enlisted persons assigned to duty in the mess detail.
Military pay acts are intended to include Coast Guard personnel specifically; this section would cover any failure to so provide for Coast Guard personnel in a pay act.

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on the following language contained in the Coast Guard appropriation act for 1949, “Pay and Allowances” and preceding years: “motion picture and other equipment for instructional purposes; . . . training of enlisted personnel, including textbooks, school supplies, and correspondence courses;” (June 19, 1948, 62 Stat. 562).

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 531.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on the following language contained in the Coast Guard appropriation act for 1949, “Pay and Allowances” and preceding years: “Not to exceed $32,200 for cost of instruction of officers at non-Federal institutions, including books, laboratory equipment and fees, school supplies, and maintenance of students;” (June 19, 1948, ch. 558, 62 Stat. 562).

§475. Leasing and hiring of quarters; rental of inadequate housing

(a) The Secretary is authorized to lease housing facilities at or near Coast Guard installations, wherever located, for assignment as public quarters to military personnel and their dependents, if any, without rental charge upon a determination by the Secretary, or his designee, that there is a lack of adequate housing facilities at or near such Coast Guard installations.
The Secretary is also authorized to lease housing facilities for assignment as public quarters, without rental charge, to military personnel who are on sea duty or duty at remote offshore Coast Guard stations and who do not have dependents.
Such authority shall be effective in any fiscal year only to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in appropriation Acts.
When any such lease involves housing facilities in a foreign country, the lease may be made on a multiyear basis for a period not to exceed five years, and, in accordance with local custom and practice, advance payment may be made for the lease.
Such public housing facilities may be leased on an individual or multiple-unit basis.
Expenditures for the rental of such housing facilities may not exceed the average authorized for the Department of Defense in any year except where the Secretary finds that the average is so low as to prevent rental of necessary housing facilities in some areas, in which event he is authorized to reallocate existing funds to high-cost areas so that rental expenditures in such areas exceed the average authorized for the Department of Defense.

(b) The Secretary is authorized, subject to regulations approved by the President—

(1) to designate as rental housing such housing as he may determine to be inadequate as public quarters; and

(2) to lease inadequate housing to members of the Coast Guard for occupancy by them and their dependents.

(c) Where sufficient quarters are not possessed by the United States, the Commandant may hire quarters for personnel, including personnel on sea duty at such times as they may be deprived of their quarters on board ship due to repairs or other conditions which may render them uninhabitable.
Such accommodations shall not be available for occupancy by the dependents of such personnel.

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §133a (June 19, 1942, ch. 419, §2, 56 Stat. 372) and on the following language contained in the Coast Guard appropriation act for 1949, “Pay and Allowances” and preceding years: “hire of quarters for Coast Guard personnel comparable to quarters assignable on a capital ship of the Navy, as authorized by the Secretary to meet emergency conditions, including officers and men on sea duty at such times as they may be deprived of their quarters on board ship due to repairs or other conditions which may render them uninhabitable: Provided, That under this authorization no funds may be expended for the hire of quarters for occupancy by the dependents of officers or enlisted personnel” (June 19, 1948, ch. 558, 62 Stat. 562).

Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§477. Equipment to prevent accidents

The Coast Guard may make such expenditures as are deemed appropriate for promotion and maintenance of the safety and occupational health of, and the prevention of accidents affecting, personnel of the Coast Guard, including the purchase of clothing, equipment, and other materials necessary thereto.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 532.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Derived from title 5, U.S.C., 1946, ed., §118g (Aug. 2, 1946, ch. 744, §13, 60 Stat. 809).

Because of the wide variety of tasks assigned to Coast Guard personnel it is deemed advisable to broaden this authority to the more general language as rewritten, insofar as Coast Guard personnel are concerned, thus giving complete authority to protect their health.

Said section would in no way be affected.

Inasmuch as the act cited above applies to executive departments generally, it is not scheduled for repeal by this act. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

Transfer of Functions

For transfer of authorities, functions, personnel, and assets of the Coast Guard, including the authorities and functions of the Secretary of Transportation relating thereto, to the Department of Homeland Security, and for treatment of related references, see sections 468(b), 551(d), 552(d), and 557 of Title 6, Domestic Security, and the Department of Homeland Security Reorganization Plan of November 25, 2002, as modified, set out as a note under section 542 of Title 6.

Hypothermia Protective Clothing Requirement

Pub. L. 107–295, title IV, §410, Nov. 25, 2002, 116 Stat. 2118, provided that: “The Commandant of the Coast Guard shall ensure that all Coast Guard personnel are equipped with adequate safety equipment, including hypothermia protective clothing where appropriate, while performing search and rescue missions.”

§478. Rations or commutation therefor in money

(a) Enlisted members of the Coast Guard, civilian officers and civilian crews of vessels, and working parties in the field shall be allowed a ration or commutation thereof in money, in such amount and under limitations and regulations prescribed by the Secretary.

(b) Money for commuted rations shall be paid, under such regulations as the Secretary shall prescribe, on proper vouchers, or pay rolls, to persons entitled to receive it, or to the officers designated by the Commandant to administer the financial affairs of the messes in which such persons may be subsisted.

(c) Money paid for commuted rations to the designated officer may be deposited in general or limited depositories of public money or in any bank in which deposits are insured.
Such funds shall be expended and accounted for under such regulations as the Secretary shall prescribe.

(d) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed as modifying or changing in any manner the provisions of law pertaining to subsistence allowances for enlisted members, but no ration or commutation thereof shall be allowed a person receiving a subsistence allowance.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 532; Pub. L. 98–557, §15(a)(3)(B), (C), Oct. 30, 1984, 98 Stat. 2865.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§134, 135 (Mar. 25, 1940, ch. 71, title I, 54 Stat. 64; June 6, 1940, ch. 257, §10, 54 Stat. 248; May 31, 1941, ch. 156, title I, §1, 55 Stat. 221; Feb. 7, 1942, ch. 46, title I, 56 Stat. 71; June 26, 1943, ch. 147, §1, 57 Stat. 211; June 22, 1944, ch. 269, §1, 58 Stat. 316; May 29, 1945, ch. 130, §1, 59 Stat. 216; July 12, 1946, ch. 569, §1, 60 Stat. 531; Aug. 2, 1946, ch. 756, §31, 60 Stat. 857; July 1, 1947, ch. 186, title I, §101, 61 Stat. 226).

The provisions of said section 134 are extended to include all persons who might be entitled to receive money for commuted rations, rather than only the officer in charge of the mess.

The last proviso of said section 135 is eliminated, because experience during the past 2 years shows that it may react detrimentally on enlisted men in time of rising food costs.

Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§479. Sales of ration supplies to messes

Ration supplies may be purchased by the cabin, wardroom, warrant officers’, and other authorized messes and payment therefor made in cash to the commissary officer.
The prices to be charged for such supplies shall not be less than the invoice prices, and the cash received from such sales shall be accounted for on the ration return and may be expended for the general mess.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 533.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §132 (Aug. 1, 1914, ch. 223, §1, 38 Stat. 620). 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§480. Flight rations

There may be furnished to officers, enlisted members, and civilian employees, while actually engaged in flight operations, an aircraft flight ration in kind, chargeable to the proper Coast Guard appropriation, which flight ration shall be supplementary to any ration or subsistence allowance now granted to such personnel.
No part of an aircraft flight ration shall be furnished without cost to any person in a travel status or to any person to whom a per diem allowance is granted in lieu of actual subsistence.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 533; Pub. L. 98–557, §15(a)(3)(B), Oct. 30, 1984, 98 Stat. 2865.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Derived from the title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §909 (June 5, 1942, ch. 327, 56 Stat. 308).

Said section is applicable to Navy personnel only.
Experience has shown that similar authority should be granted to the Coast Guard; it will operate to the benefit of Navy personnel stopping over at Coast Guard air stations as well as to the benefit of Coast Guard personnel stopping over at Naval air stations.

The language of said section is closely paralleled.

Said section would in no way be affected. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§481. Payments at time of discharge for good of service

Enlisted members discharged by dishonorable discharge, bad-conduct discharge, or any other discharge for the good of the service, may, upon discharge, be paid a sum not to exceed $25. The sum paid shall be fixed by and in the discretion of the Commandant, and shall be paid only in cases where the person so discharged would otherwise be without funds to meet his immediate needs.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 533; Pub. L. 98–557, §15(a)(3)(C), Oct. 30, 1984, 98 Stat. 2865.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Derived from title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §197, and title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §3a (Mar. 4, 1925, ch. 536, §10, 43 Stat. 1274; Oct. 26, 1942, ch. 623, 56 Stat. 987).

Said section 197 was made applicable to the Coast Guard by title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §3a whenever the Coast Guard is operating with the Navy.
Experience has shown the advantage of having such a provision applicable to the Coast Guard at all times.

Said section would in no way be affected. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§482. Clothing at time of discharge for good of service

Enlisted members discharged for bad conduct, undesirability, unsuitability, or inaptitude may be furnished civilian clothing, including an overcoat when necessary, the cost of such furnished clothing not to exceed $30, per person.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 533; Pub. L. 98–557, §15(a)(3)(C), Oct. 30, 1984, 98 Stat. 2865.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §148 (Dec. 23, 1943, ch. 380, title I, 57 Stat. 628).

Inasmuch as the act cited above applies equally to the Navy and Marine Corps as well as the Coast Guard, it is not scheduled for repeal but is being amended by section 18 of this act to eliminate reference to the Coast Guard.

Changes in phraseology were made in order to adapt said section to this revision. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§483. Right to wear uniform

When authorized by and in accordance with applicable regulations:

(a) any member who has served honorably in the Coast Guard during war shall when not in active service, whether or not on the retired list, be entitled to bear the official title and upon occasions of ceremony to wear the uniform of the highest rank or rating held by him during his war service, and

(b) any member on the retired list shall be entitled to wear the uniform of his rank or rating.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 533; Pub. L. 98–557, §15(a)(3)(H), Oct. 30, 1984, 98 Stat. 2865.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Subsection (a) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §167b–2 (June 21, 1930, ch. 563, §2, 46 Stat. 793).

Inasmuch as the act cited above applies equally to the Navy and Marine Corps as well as the Coast Guard, it is not scheduled for repeal but is being amended by section 12 of this act to eliminate reference to the Coast Guard.

Subsection (b) is new to the Coast Guard, although it has been the practice for retired officers to wear the uniform when they so desire.
Such authority is granted to retired officers of the Navy (see title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §389).

Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

Wearing of Uniform Authorized by President

Act June 21, 1930, ch. 563, §2, 46 Stat. 793, upon which subsec. (a) of this section was based, was amended by act July 6, 1953, ch. 180, §2, 67 Stat. 140, to substitute “Authorized by regulations of the President” for “of ceremony”.

§484. Protection of uniform

The provisions of law relating to the protection of the uniform of the United States Army, Navy, or Marine Corps shall apply to the protection of the uniform of the Coast Guard, in the same manner, to the same extent, and under the same conditions.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 533.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §39 (Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 418, §1, 39 Stat. 649).

The assimilation is made in general terms, rather than by reference to the applicable section in title 10, U.S.C., 1946 ed. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§485. Clothing for officers and enlisted personnel

(a) The Coast Guard may purchase uniforms, accouterments, and related equipment for sale to officer personnel and cadets of the Coast Guard.

(b) The Coast Guard may purchase uniform clothing for sale to enlisted personnel of the Coast Guard.
The actual cost of the clothing thus sold to enlisted personnel may be withheld from their pay.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 534; Aug. 3, 1950, ch. 536, §33, 64 Stat. 408; Pub. L. 87–649, §14d(4), Sept. 7, 1962, 76 Stat. 502.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Subsection (a) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §30 (Jan. 12, 1919, ch. 8, 40 Stat. 1054). Said section was changed to have application to the Coast Guard at all times, rather than when the Coast Guard is operating with the Navy.

Inasmuch as the act cited above applies equally to the Navy and Marine Corps as well as the Coast Guard, it is not scheduled for repeal but is being amended by section 9 of this act to eliminate reference to the Coast Guard.

Subsection (b) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946, ed., §13, and on title 33, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §754 (July 1, 1898, ch. 346, §1, 30 Stat. 604; July 27, 1912, ch. 255, §2, 37 Stat. 239). Said section 13 was changed to have application to all enlisted personnel rather than to “crews of vessels in service” only.
The provision of said section 754 which provided for the sale of clothing to civilian employees is eliminated as becoming obsolete.

Subsection (c) is new.
Title 37, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §110 authorizes the payment of a cash allowance in case clothing is not furnished to enlisted persons of the Coast Guard.
Clearly this presumes the authority to issue clothing to enlisted persons; this section makes the authority statutory. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§486. Clothing for destitute shipwrecked persons

The Coast Guard may furnish clothing and subsistence to destitute shipwrecked persons, and the Coast Guard may reimburse, in cash or in kind, Coast Guard personnel who furnish clothing and subsistence to destitute ship- wrecked persons.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 534.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 33, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §749 (July 27, 1912, ch. 255, §2, 37 Stat. 239; Mar. 4, 1913, ch. 141, §1, 37 Stat. 736).

This section was enlarged to provide that the Coast Guard, as well as personnel thereof, may furnish clothing and subsistence to destitute shipwrecked persons.

Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§487. Procurement and sale of stores to members and civilian employees

Such stores as the Secretary may designate may be procured and sold to members of the Coast Guard, and to the surviving spouses of such members.
Such designated stores may also be procured and sold to civilian officers and employees of the United States, and to such other persons as may be specifically authorized by the Secretary, at Coast Guard stations and other units beyond the continental limits of the United States or in Alaska.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 534; Pub. L. 98–557, §15(a)(2), (3)(D), (4)(D)(i), Oct. 30, 1984, 98 Stat. 2865, 2866.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Derived from title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §533 (Mar. 3, 1909, ch. 255, 35 Stat. 768; Apr. 14, 1937, ch. 78, 50 Stat. 63; June 10, 1939, ch. 196, 53 Stat. 814; Jan. 23, 1942, ch. 15, 56 Stat. 13; Apr. 9, 1943, ch. 39, 57 Stat. 60).

Said section granted authority for the Secretary of the Navy to sell designated stores to officers and enlisted men.
It is deemed desirable to grant similar authority to the Secretary having control of the Coast Guard.

Said section would in no way be affected. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§488. Advancement of public funds to personnel

The Commandant, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, may advance public funds to personnel when required to meet expenses of members detailed on emergency shore duty.
Funds so advanced shall not exceed a reasonable estimate of the actual expenditures to be made and for which reimbursement is authorized by law.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 534; Pub. L. 98–557, §15(a)(3)(I), Oct. 30, 1984, 98 Stat. 2865.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Derived from title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §885, and title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §3a (May 22, 1928, ch. 688, 45 Stat. 712; Oct. 26, 1942, ch. 623, 56 Stat. 987).

Said section 885 was made applicable to the Coast Guard by title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §3a whenever the Coast Guard is operating with the Navy.
Experience has shown the advantage of having such a provision applicable to the Coast Guard at all times.

Said section would in no way be affected. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§491a. Coast Guard cross

The President may award a Coast Guard cross of appropriate design, with ribbons and appurtenances, to a person who, while serving in any capacity with the Coast Guard, when the Coast Guard is not operating under the Department of the Navy, distinguishes himself or herself by extraordinary heroism not justifying the award of a medal of honor—

(1) while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States;

(2) while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force or international terrorist organization; or

(3) while serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party.

(Added Pub. L. 111–281, title II, §224(a), Oct. 15, 2010, 124 Stat. 2921.)

§492. Distinguished service medal

The President may present, but not in the name of Congress, a distinguished service medal of appropriate design, with accompanying ribbon, together with a rosette or other device, to be worn in lieu thereof, to any person who, while serving in any capacity with the Coast Guard, distinguishes himself by exceptionally meritorious service to the Government in a duty of great responsibility.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 535.)

Historical and Revision Notes

This section is new insofar as application to Coast Guard personnel in time of peace is concerned.
Such awards can be made to members of the Coast Guard when the Coast Guard is operating with the Navy.

The language is parallel to that found in title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §355, providing for awards to personnel of the Navy. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

Sec. 2. The Homeland Security Distinguished Service Medal and appurtenances thereto shall be of appropriate design approved by the Secretary of Homeland Security and shall be awarded under such regulations as the Secretary shall prescribe.

The President may award a silver star medal of appropriate design, with ribbons and appurtenances, to a person who, while serving in any capacity with the Coast Guard, when the Coast Guard is not operating under the Department of the Navy, is cited for gallantry in action that does not warrant a medal of honor or Coast Guard cross—

(1) while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States;

(2) while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force or international terrorist organization; or

(3) while serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party.

§492b. Distinguished flying cross

The President may present, but not in the name of Congress, a distinguished flying cross of appropriate design, with accompanying ribbon, to any person who, while serving in any capacity with the Coast Guard, distinguishes himself by heroism or extraordinary achievement while participating in an aerial flight.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 535.)

Historical and Revision Notes

This section establishes a new medal to be known as the Coast Guard Medal, which is intended to be a parallel award to the Navy and Marine Corps Medal of the Navy, to be awarded under the same circumstances as that medal is awarded to personnel of the Navy (see title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §356b). 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§494. Insignia for additional awards

No more than one medal of honor, Coast Guard cross, distinguished service medal, silver star medal, distinguished flying cross, or one Coast Guard medal shall be issued to any one person; but for each succeeding deed or service sufficient to justify the awarding of a medal of honor, Coast Guard cross, distinguished service medal, silver star medal, distinguished flying cross, or Coast Guard medal, the President may award a suitable emblem or insignia to be worn with the decoration and a corresponding rosette or other device.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 535; Aug. 10, 1956, ch. 1041, §13, 70A Stat. 624; Pub. L. 111–281, title II, §224(c)(1), Oct. 15, 2010, 124 Stat. 2922.)

Historical and Revision Notes

This section is supplemental to the preceding sections dealing with the award of medals and regulates the award of additional medals of the same kind.

(1) the award is made within five years after the date of the deed or service justifying the award;

(2) a statement setting forth the deed or distinguished service and recommending official recognition of it was made by his superior through official channels within three years from the date of that deed or termination of the service.

(b) If the Secretary determines that—

(1) a statement setting forth the deed or distinguished service and recommending official recognition of it was made by the person's superior through official channels within three years from the date of that deed or termination of the service and was supported by sufficient evidence within that time; and

(2) no award was made, because the statement was lost or through inadvertence the recommendation was not acted upon; a medal of honor, Coast Guard cross, distinguished service medal, silver star medal, distinguished flying cross, Coast Guard medal, or bar, emblem, or insignia in lieu thereof, as the case may be, may be awarded to the person within two years after the date of that determination.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 536; Pub. L. 87–526, §1(5), July 10, 1962, 76 Stat. 141; Pub. L. 111–281, title II, §224(c)(2), Oct. 15, 2010, 124 Stat. 2922.)

Historical and Revision Notes

This section establishes a time limit on the making of awards.
It follows the established practice in all the armed forces (see title 10, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §1409 and title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §360). 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§497. Honorable subsequent service as condition to award

No medal of honor, Coast Guard cross, distinguished service medal, silver star medal, distinguished flying cross, Coast Guard medal, or emblem, or insignia in lieu thereof shall be awarded or presented to any individual, or to the representative of any individual, whose entire service subsequent to the time he distinguished himself shall not in the opinion of the Commandant have been honorable.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 536; Aug. 10, 1956, ch. 1041, §13, 70A Stat. 624; Pub. L. 111–281, title II, §224(c)(3), Oct. 15, 2010, 124 Stat. 2922.)

Historical and Revision Notes

This section makes honorable service subsequent to the act for which award is made, a condition precedent to granting the award.
The Navy has the same statutory condition (see title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §362). 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§498. Posthumous awards

In case an individual who distinguishes himself dies before the making of any award to which he may be entitled, as authorized in this chapter, the award may be made and presented within five years from the date of the act or service justifying the award to such next of kin as may have been designated by the individual, or in the absence of such designation, or if the designated person is not alive at the time of the award, or the relationship between such person and the serviceman shall have been terminated before his death, then to such representative as the President designates.
In the event of a posthumous award when the award will be made to the parents of the deceased and the parents have been divorced or separated, a duplicate award may be made to each parent.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 536.)

Historical and Revision Notes

This section sets forth the conditions under which posthumous awards can be made.
It is substantially the same as conditions for the Navy, but has the added provision for duplicate awards in case the parents are divorced or separated (see title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §363). 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§499. Delegation of powers to make awards; rules and regulations

The President may delegate to the Secretary, under such conditions, regulations, and limitations as he prescribes, the powers conferred upon him to make the awards designated in this chapter, and the President may make any and all rules, regulations, and orders which he deems necessary in the conferring of such awards.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 536.)

Historical and Revision Notes

This section provides for the delegation of powers to make awards to the Secretary.
The Navy statute provides for such delegation to force commanders (see title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §364). 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§500. Life-saving medals

(a) The Secretary may, under regulations prescribed by him, award a Life-saving medal of gold or silver to any person, including personnel of the Coast Guard, who rescues or endeavors to rescue any other person from drowning, shipwreck, or other peril of the water in accordance with the following provisions:

(1) if such rescue or attempted rescue is made at the risk of one's own life and evidences extreme and heroic daring, the medal shall be of gold;

(2) if such rescue or attempted rescue is not sufficiently distinguished to deserve the medal of gold, but evidences the exercise of such signal exertion as to merit recognition, the medal shall be of silver.

(b) In order for a person to be eligible for the Life-saving Medals the rescue or attempted rescue must take place in waters within the United States or subject to the jurisdiction thereof, or if the rescue or attempted rescue takes place outside such waters, one or the other of the parties must be a citizen of the United States or from a vessel or aircraft owned or operated by citizens of the United States.

(c) No person shall receive more than one gold medal and one silver medal; but any person who has received or may hereafter receive a gold or silver medal and who again performs an act which would entitle him to receive another medal of the same class may be awarded, in lieu of a second medal of the same class, a gold or silver bar, as the case may be, to be worn with the medal already bestowed, and for every such additional act, an additional bar may be awarded.
Medals and bars in lieu thereof, authorized by this subsection, may be awarded posthumously.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 536; Pub. L. 94–546, §1(31), Oct. 18, 1976, 90 Stat. 2521.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§193, 194, 195, 196 (June 20, 1874, ch. 344, §7, 18 Stat. 127; June 18, 1878, ch. 265, §12, 20 Stat. 165; May 4, 1882, ch. 117, §9, 22 Stat. 57; Jan. 21, 1897, ch. 83, 29 Stat. 494).

Said sections have been rewritten so as to make the awarding of Life-saving medals turn on whether or not the United States has an interest in the heroic act, rather than on technical jurisdictional grounds.
Under existing law the award of a medal could be made in any case in which the rescuer or the rescued was a citizen of the United States, or was from a vessel owned or operated by the United States regardless of where the rescue took place; and if the rescue took place within waters of the United States the award could be made to an alien.

The existing law relating to the Treasury Department Life-Saving Medal contained in title 14, U.S.C., 1946, ed., §§192–196, has long needed revision.
The existing law is composed of a series of statutes enacted separately between 1874 and 1897, and the result has not been entirely unsatisfactory.
The original statute, enacted in 1874 (title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §193), provided for Life-saving medals of the first and second class to be bestowed “upon any persons who shall hereafter endanger their own lives in saving, or endeavoring to save lives from the perils of the sea, within the United States, or upon any American vessel”. The medal of the first class was confined to cases of “extreme and heroic daring” and the medal of the second class was to be awarded “in cases not sufficiently distinguished to deserve the medal of the first class” Then in 1878 another act was passed (title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §194) authorizing the bestowal of the medal of the second class “upon persons making such signal exertions in rescuing and succoring the shipwrecked, and saving persons from drowning” as, in the opinion of the Secretary of the Treasury, merited recognition.
These two sections were construed by the Attorney General to be limited to the rescue of persons who were subjected to the perils of the sea in any waters of the United States in the vicinity of any lifeboat station, life-saving station, or house of refuge.
And the person upon whom the medal could be bestowed was limited to members of life-saving crews. (1895) Op. Att.
Gen. 124. Thereupon, in 1897, an act was passed which provided that the two earlier acts should “be construed so as to empower the Secretary of the Treasury to bestow such medals upon persons making signal exertions in rescuing and succoring the shipwrecked and saving persons from drowning in waters over which the United States has jurisdiction, whether the said persons making such exertions were or were not members of the Life-Saving Service or whether or not such exertions were made in the vicinity of a life-saving station”. (Title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §196.) This act was designed to give a more liberal application to the two earlier acts, and all three were to be read as one. (1900) 23 Op. Atty.
Gen. 78. However, difficult questions of interpretation have arisen because of the different jurisdictional language in the three acts.
For example, title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §193, refers to rescues “within the United States”, while title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §196, refers to rescues “in the waters over which the United States has jurisdiction”. The need for clarification is obvious.
Subsection (a) authorizes the awarding of the medal to any person, including Coast Guard personnel, who rescues or endeavors to rescue any person from drowning, shipwreck, or peril of the water.
If the rescue or attempted rescue is at the risk of one's own life and evidences extreme and heroic daring, the medal shall be of gold, and if the rescue or attempted rescue is not sufficiently distinguished to deserve the gold medal, but evidences the exertion of such signal exertion as to merit recognition, the medal shall be of silver.
Thus, the acts for which the medals are to be awarded are defined simply and without any geographical or jurisdictional limitations.
The difficulty with the existing law is the attempt to define the required deed together with those limitations.
Subsection (a) does not change existing law insofar as the type of act necessary for the medals is concerned; it merely simplifies and clarifies existing law.

Subsection (b) contains the jurisdictional limitations on the awarding of the medal and broadens, to a considerable extent, the provisions of existing law.
It is the intent of this subsection to authorize the awarding of a medal in all cases where the United States has a legitimate interest in recognizing meritorious acts, such as where a United States citizen performs the act, or where a United States citizen is rescued, or where United States waters or United States vessels or aircraft are involved.
Accordingly, rescues by United States citizens anywhere in the world will be recognized.
Any person, including persons not citizens of the United States, may receive medals if the rescue or attempted rescue takes place in waters within the United States or subject to its jurisdiction or, in cases of rescues outside such waters, if either the rescuer or the person rescued is from a United States vessel or aircraft, or the person rescued is a United States citizen.
Thus, every case in which the United States government has an interest is provided for.
A United States citizen who performs a heroic act sufficient to justify a medal in state waters, or in foreign waters, could not receive one under existing law, but could receive such award under this proposed revision.
The awarding of medals should not turn on technical jurisdictional grounds; it should turn rather on the interest of the United States to recognize noble and heroic acts.

Subsection (c) dealing with the awarding of bars for additional acts, clarifies, but does not change title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §195, except that authority is granted to award medals posthumously. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§501. Replacement of medals

In those cases where a medal, or a bar, emblem, or insignia in lieu thereof, awarded pursuant to this chapter has been stolen, lost, destroyed, or rendered unfit for use without fault or neglect on the part of the person to whom it was awarded, such medal, or bar, emblem, or insignia in lieu thereof, shall be replaced without charge, or, in the discretion of the Secretary, upon condition that the Government is reimbursed for the cost thereof.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 537; Pub. L. 107–107, div. A, title V, §553(d)(2), Dec. 28, 2001, 115 Stat. 1117.)

Historical and Revision Notes

This section provides for the replacement of medals.
It follows the established practice of the other armed forces, but makes an additional provision that the Secretary in his discretion may charge for the replacement medals in some circumstances. (See title 10, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §1416 and title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §359.) 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§502. Award of other medals

Coast Guard personnel, notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter, may be awarded medals, bars, emblems, or insignia to which such personnel may be entitled under other provisions of law.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 537.)

Historical and Revision Notes

This section insures that the preceding sections are not intended to prevent Coast Guard military personnel from receiving other medals, the legion of merit, for example. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

Meritorious Service Medal

Medal established as an award for outstanding meritorious achievement or service to the United States, see Ex. Ord.
No. 11448, Jan. 16, 1969, 34 F.R. 915, as amended, set out as a note preceding section 1121 of Title 10, Armed Forces.

§503. Awards and insignia for excellence in service or conduct

The Coast Guard may award trophies, badges, and cash prizes to Coast Guard personnel or groups thereof, including personnel of the reserve components thereof whether or not on active duty, for excellence in accomplishments related to Coast Guard service, to incur such expenses as may be necessary to enter such personnel in competitions, and to provide badges or buttons in recognition of special service, good conduct, and discharge under conditions other than dishonorable.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 537.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on the following language contained in the Coast Guard appropriation act for 1949, “Pay and Allowances” and preceding years: “not exceeding $10,000 for cash prizes for men for excellence in boatmanship, gunnery, target practice, and engineering competitions” (June 19, 1948, ch. 558, 62 Stat. 561).

This section expands the language contained in the appropriation act to include the awarding of trophies and badges, and to include in the accomplishments for which such awards may be made, excellence in any field related to Coast Guard duty. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§504. Medal of honor: duplicate medal

A person awarded a medal of honor shall, upon written application of that person, be issued, without charge, one duplicate medal of honor with ribbons and appurtenances.
Such duplicate medal of honor shall be marked, in such manner as the Secretary may determine, as a duplicate or for display purposes only.

(a) In General.—The Commandant shall submit a report to the appropriate congressional committees and the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives as soon as possible, but not later than 30 days, after the Chief Acquisition Officer of the Coast Guard becomes aware of the breach of an acquisition program baseline for any Level 1 or Level 2 acquisition program, by—

(1) a likely cost overrun greater than 15 percent of the acquisition program baseline for that individual capability or asset or a class of capabilities or assets;

(2) a likely delay of more than 180 days in the delivery schedule for any individual capability or asset or class of capabilities or assets; or

(3) an anticipated failure for any individual capability or asset or class of capabilities or assets to satisfy any key performance threshold or parameter under the acquisition program baseline.

(b) Content.—The report submitted under subsection (a) shall include—

(1) a detailed description of the breach and an explanation of its cause;

(1) the capability or asset or capability or asset class to be acquired under the project or program is essential to the accomplishment of Coast Guard missions;

(2) there are no alternatives to such capability or asset or capability or asset class that will provide equal or greater capability in both a more cost-effective and timely manner;

(3) the new acquisition schedule and estimates for total acquisition cost are reasonable; and

§631. Delegation of powers by the Secretary

The Secretary is authorized to confer or impose upon the Commandant any of the rights, privileges, powers, or duties, in respect to the administration of the Coast Guard, vested in or imposed upon the Secretary by this title or other provisions of law.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 544; Pub. L. 94–546, §1(33), Oct. 18, 1976, 90 Stat. 2521.)

Historical and Revision Notes

This section authorizes the Secretary to delegate to the Commandant any of the authority granted to him in respect to the administration of the Coast Guard.
Such power to delegate is granted by other statutes to the heads of many of the executive departments. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

Administrative Advisory Committees; Solicitation of Nominations for Membership; Publication in Federal Register; Disclosures to Congress; Compensation and Travel Expenses

Pub. L. 97–322, title I, §118(e), Oct. 15, 1982, 96 Stat. 1587, provided that:

“(1) The Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating shall, not less often than once a year, publish notice in the Federal Register for solicitation of nominations for membership on any advisory committee established administratively for the purpose of giving advice and recommendations to such Secretary or the Commandant of the Coast Guard with respect to functions of the Coast Guard.

“(2) Any advisory committee described in paragraph (1) of this subsection is authorized to make available to Congress any information, advice, and recommendations which the committee is authorized to give to the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating or the Commandant of the Coast Guard.

“(3) Members of any advisory committee described in paragraph (1) of this subsection who are not officers or employees of the United States shall serve without pay and members of any such committee who are officers or employees of the United States shall receive no additional pay on account of their service on such committee.
While away from their homes or regular places of business, members of any such committee may be allowed travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by section 5703 of title 5, United States Code.”

§632. Functions and powers vested in the Commandant

All powers and functions conferred upon the Coast Guard, or the Commandant, by or pursuant to this title or any other law shall, unless otherwise specifically stated, be executed by the Commandant subject to the general supervision of the Secretary.
In order to execute the powers and functions vested in him, the Commandant may assign personnel of the Coast Guard to duty in the District of Columbia, elsewhere in the United States, in any territory of the United States, and in any foreign country, but such personnel shall not be assigned to duties in any foreign country without the consent of the government of that country; assign to such personnel such duties and authority as he deems necessary; and issue rules, orders, and instructions, not inconsistent with law, relating to the organization, internal administration, and personnel of the Coast Guard.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 545.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 5, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §41, and on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed. §§22, 58, 91, 99, 103 (R.S. 2749; June 18, 1878, ch. 265, §§7, 8, 22 Stat. 164; May 4, 1882, ch. 117, §5, 22 Stat. 57; Mar. 4, 1907, ch. 2918, 34 Stat. 1309; Jan. 28, 1915, ch. 20, §1, 38 Stat. 800; Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601; June 10, 1921, ch. 18, §304, 42 Stat. 23; July 3, 1926, ch. 742, §9, 44 Stat. 817).

Said section 91 has been divided.
That part dealing with investigation of plans and inventions is covered in section 93(d) of this title.
The remainder is covered in general terms.
It has been rewritten in broad terms, making clear that the Commandant is granted the necessary authority to administer the Coast Guard under the Secretary, including authority to issue rules, orders, and instructions.

This section is primarily a consolidation of existing functions rather than a codification of existing laws.
It does not, for the most part, grant new authority to the Coast Guard as an organization.
It merely clarifies the method by which Coast Guard functions shall be administered.
Under existing statutes, functions relating to the Coast Guard have been conferred upon the President, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Commandant, and sometimes upon the Secretary of the Treasury in times of peace and the Secretary of the Navy in times of war.
This revision confers some functions directly upon the Coast Guard, and this section provides for the execution of those functions by the Commandant, the military head of the organization, thereby making for consistency and uniformity.
The functions are to be executed “subject to the general supervision of the Secretary”. Title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §91 now grants authority to the Commandant to prescribe regulations; this is changed to the issuance of rules, orders, and instructions as the promulgation of regulations in a military organization is properly a function of the Secretary.

Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§633. Regulations

In addition to the authority conferred by other provisions of this title the Secretary may promulgate such regulations and orders as he deems appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title or any other law applicable to the Coast Guard.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 545.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§92, 185e (June 20, 1874, ch. 344, §8, 18 Stat. 127; May 26, 1906, ch. 2556, §1, 34 Stat. 200; May 24, 1939, ch. 146, §6, 53 Stat. 756).

This section enlarges said sections to prescribe what is generally understood in a military organization, that the promulgation of regulations is a function of the head of the Department.

Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§634. Officers holding certain offices

(a) Any officer, including any petty officer, may be designated by the Commandant as captain of the port or ports or adjacent high seas or waters over which the United States has jurisdiction, as the Commandant deems necessary to facilitate execution of Coast Guard duties.

(b) Commissioned officers may be appointed as United States Deputy Marshals in Alaska.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 545; Pub. L. 86–70, §11, June 25, 1959, 73 Stat. 143; Pub. L. 97–295, §2(18), Oct. 12, 1982, 96 Stat. 1302.)

Historical and Revision Notes

1949 Act

Subsection (a) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §48 (June 22, 1936, ch. 705, §4, 49 Stat. 1821; July 11, 1941, ch. 290, §7, 55 Stat. 585).

Subsection (b) is derived from the last 6 lines of title 48, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §1460 (July 31, 1939, ch. 399, 53 Stat. 1143). An additional provision is added waiving the requirement of a performance bond inasmuch as Coast Guard officers appointed as United States commissioners or marshals are not custodians of funds, and in any case their oath as a commissioned officer appears to be sufficient to insure faithful performance of duty.

Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

1982 Act

This amends 14:634(b) to reflect the effect of 28:631(c) and sections 401(a) and 402(a) of the Federal Magistrates Act (Pub. L. 90–578, Oct. 17, 1968, 82 Stat. 1118).

§635. Oaths required for boards

The members of a retiring board, selection board, examining board, and any other board authorized to be assembled pursuant to this title shall be sworn to discharge their duties honestly and impartially, the oath to be administered to the members by the President or other presiding officer of the board, and to him by the junior member or recorder.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 545.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §170 (Apr. 12, 1902, ch. 501, §5, 32 Stat. 100).

Said section has been divided.
That part relating to oaths is covered in this section.
The remainder is covered in section 425 of this title.

Said section is enlarged to include the oaths required for all boards, rather than to cover retiring boards only. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§636. Administration of oaths

(a) Such commissioned and warrant officers of the Coast Guard as may be designated by the Commandant may, pursuant to rules prescribed by the Commandant, exercise the general powers of a notary public in the administration of oaths for the following purposes:

(1) execution, acknowledgment, and attestation of instruments and papers, oaths of allegiance in connection with recruiting, oaths in connection with courts and boards, and all other notarial acts in connection with the proper execution of Coast Guard functions;

(2) execution, acknowledgment, and attestation of instruments and papers, and all other notarial acts in time of war or national emergency; and

(3) execution, acknowledgment, and attestation of instruments and papers, and all other notarial acts in Alaska and places beyond the continental limits of the United States where the Coast Guard is serving.

(b) No fee of any character shall be charged by any commissioned or warrant officer for performing notarial acts.
The signature and indication of grade of any commissioned or warrant officer performing any notarial act shall be prima facie evidence of his authority.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 545.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§26, 27 (Apr. 16, 1908, ch. 145, §12, 35 Stat. 63; June 5, 1920, ch. 235, §1, 41 Stat. 880).

Said sections are rewritten, the provisions concerning oaths being broadened to conform more closely to law applicable to officers of the Navy (see title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §217a). 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§637. Stopping vessels; indemnity for firing at or into vessel

(a)(1) Whenever any vessel liable to seizure or examination does not stop on being ordered to do so or on being pursued by an authorized vessel or authorized aircraft which has displayed the ensign, pennant, or other identifying insignia prescribed for an authorized vessel or authorized aircraft, the person in command or in charge of the authorized vessel or authorized aircraft may, subject to paragraph (2), fire at or into the vessel which does not stop.

(2) Before firing at or into a vessel as authorized in paragraph (1), the person in command or in charge of the authorized vessel or authorized aircraft shall fire a gun as a warning signal, except that the prior firing of a gun as a warning signal is not required if that person determines that the firing of a warning signal would unreasonably endanger persons or property in the vicinity of the vessel to be stopped.

(b) The person in command of an authorized vessel or authorized aircraft and all persons acting under that person's direction shall be indemnified from any penalties or actions for damages for firing at or into a vessel pursuant to subsection (a). If any person is killed or wounded by the firing, and the person in command of the authorized vessel or authorized aircraft or any person acting pursuant to their orders is prosecuted or arrested therefor, they shall be forthwith admitted to bail.

(c) A vessel or aircraft is an authorized vessel or authorized aircraft for purposes of this section if—

(1) it is a Coast Guard vessel or aircraft;

(2) it is a surface naval vessel or military aircraft on which one or more members of the Coast Guard are assigned pursuant to section 379 of title 10; or

(3) any 1 other vessel or aircraft on government noncommercial service when—

(A) the vessel or aircraft is under the tactical control of the Coast Guard; and

(B) at least one member of the Coast Guard is assigned and conducting a Coast Guard mission on the vessel or aircraft.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 546; Pub. L. 100–690, title VII, §7401(a), Nov. 18, 1988, 102 Stat. 4483; Pub. L. 106–65, div. A, title X, §1022, Oct. 5, 1999, 113 Stat. 746; Pub.

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §68 (R.S. 2765).

Aircraft are included within the protective terms of this section which permits aircraft to stop vessels but makes no provision for stopping aircraft.

Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

Report on Vessels or Aircraft Fired At or Into Without Warning

Pub. L. 108–293, title II, §205(d), Aug. 9, 2004, 118 Stat. 1033, which required the Commandant of the Coast Guard to transmit an annual report to Congress describing the location, vessels or aircraft, circumstances, and consequences of each incident in which an authorized vessel or an authorized aircraft fired at or into a vessel without prior use of the warning signal as authorized by this section, was repealed by Pub. L. 111–207, §4(a)(5), July 27, 2010, 124 Stat. 2251.

[Pub. L. 111–207, §4(a)(5), which directed the repeal of section 205(d) of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006, was executed by repealing section 205(d) of Pub. L. 108–293, the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2004, formerly set out above, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.]

1 So in original.
Probably should be preceded by “it is”.

§638. Coast Guard ensigns and pennants

(a) Vessels and aircraft authorized by the Secretary shall be distinguished from other vessels and aircraft by an ensign, pennant, or other identifying insignia of such design as prescribed by the Secretary.
Such ensign, pennant, or other identifying insignia shall be displayed in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.

(b) No vessel or aircraft without authority shall carry, hoist, or display any ensign, pennant, or other identifying insignia prescribed for, or intended to resemble, any ensign, pennant, or other identifying insignia prescribed for Coast Guard vessels or aircraft.
Every person violating this subsection shall be fined not more than $5,000, or imprisoned for not more than two years, or both.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 546; Pub. L. 111–281, title II, §213(b), Oct. 15, 2010, 124 Stat. 2915.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §64 (R.S. 2764; Aug. 5, 1935, ch. 438, title III, §308, 49 Stat. 528).

Aircraft are included within the provisions of this section.

The Secretary rather than the President is given the authority to design ensigns and pennants.

Unauthorized display of such insignia is made illegal anywhere rather than only “within the jurisdiction of the United States”.

The language is broadened to include “any person violating this section”; existing law applies to masters of offending vessels only. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§639. Penalty for unauthorized use of words “Coast Guard”

No individual, association, partnership, or corporation shall, without authority of the Commandant, use the combination of letters “USCG” or “USCGR”, the words “Coast Guard,” “United States Coast Guard,” “Coast Guard Reserve,” “United States Coast Guard Reserve,” “Coast Guard Auxiliary,” “United States Coast Guard Auxiliary,” “Lighthouse Service,” “Life Saving Service,” or any combination or variation of such letters or words alone or with other letters or words, as the name under which he or it shall do business, for the purpose of trade, or by way of advertisement to induce the effect of leading the public to believe that any such individual, association, partnership, or corporation has any connection with the Coast Guard.
No individual, association, partnership, or corporation shall falsely advertise, or otherwise represent falsely by any device whatsoever, that any project or business in which he or it is engaged, or product which he or it manufactures, deals in, or sells, has been in any way endorsed, authorized, or approved by the Coast Guard.
Every person violating this section shall be fined not more than $1,000, or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 546; Aug. 3, 1950, ch. 536, §30, 64 Stat. 408.)

Historical and Revision Notes

This section makes the unauthorized use of the words “Coast Guard” or any derivative thereof, a crime.
This is believed to be a desirable prohibition in view of the many commercial organizations which are manufacturing equipment approved by the Coast Guard and selling same to vessels in the United States. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

Coast Guard City, USA

Pub. L. 105–383, title IV, §409, Nov. 13, 1998, 112 Stat. 3431, provided that: “The Commandant of the Coast Guard may recognize the community of Grand Haven, Michigan, as ‘Coast Guard City, USA’. If the Commandant desires to recognize any other community in the same manner or any other community requests such recognition from the Coast Guard, the Commandant shall notify the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives 90 days prior to approving such recognition.”

§640. Coast Guard band recordings for commercial sale

(a) The Coast Guard band may produce recordings for commercial sale.

Subsection (a) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §43a (Apr. 10, 1936, ch. 179, 49 Stat. 1195). The authorization is enlarged to include any public body or private organization not organized for profit, and the authority to make disposal is placed in the Commandant rather than in the Secretary.

Subsection (b) is based on title 33, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §752a (May 22, 1926, ch. 371, §5, 44 Stat. 626).

Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§642. Deposit of damage payments

Whenever an aid to navigation or other property belonging to the Coast Guard is damaged or destroyed by a private person, and such private person or his agent shall pay to the satisfaction of the proper official of the Coast Guard for the cost of repair or replacement of such property, the Commandant may accept and deposit such payments, through proper officers of the Fiscal Service, Treasury Department, in special deposit accounts in the Treasury, for payment therefrom to the person or persons repairing or replacing the damaged property and refundment of amounts collected in excess of the cost of the repairs or replacements concerned.
In the event that repair or replacement of the damaged property is effected by the Coast Guard, the appropriations bearing the cost thereof and current at the time collection is made shall be reimbursed from the special deposit account.

Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §50c (Aug. 2, 1946, ch. 756, §32, 60 Stat. 857).

Section is enlarged to provide for payment of rewards for information leading to the discovery or recovery of missing Coast Guard property. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§644. Payment for the apprehension of stragglers

The Coast Guard may offer and pay rewards for the apprehension and delivery of deserters, stragglers, and prisoners.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 547.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §147 (May 26, 1906, ch. 2556, §5, 34 Stat. 200).

Said section has been divided.
That part relating to rewards for the apprehension of deserters is placed in this section.
That part relating to the acceptance of convicted deserters in the armed forces is placed in section 575 of this title.
The first sentence of said section is eliminated inasmuch as it is believed that commanding officers in the Coast Guard are charged with the duty of apprehending deserters without special statutory authority therefor.

The limitation as to amount that could be offered is removed.

The provision concerning money due the deserter is eliminated. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

Prior Provisions

A prior section 645, acts Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, §1, 63 Stat. 547; Sept. 3, 1954, ch. 1263, §34, 68 Stat. 1239; Aug. 23, 1958, Pub. L. 85–738, §§4, 5, 72 Stat. 833, provided for settlement of claims incident to activities of Coast Guard, prior to repeal, effective two years after Sept. 26, 1968, by Pub. L. 90–525, §2, Sept. 26, 1968, 82 Stat. 877. See section 2733 of Title 10, Armed Forces.

§646. Admiralty claims against the United States

(a) The Secretary may consider, ascertain, adjust, determine, compromise, or settle, and pay in an amount not more than $100,000, an admiralty claim against the United States for—

(1) damage caused by a vessel in the Coast Guard service or by other property under the jurisdiction of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating;

(2) compensation for towage and salvage services, including contract salvage, rendered to a vessel in the Coast Guard service or to other property under the jurisdiction of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating; or

(3) damage caused by a maritime tort committed by an agent or employee of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating or by property under the jurisdiction of that Department.

(b) Upon acceptance of payment by the claimant, the settlement or compromise of a claim under this section is final and conclusive notwithstanding any other law.

(c) If a claim under this section is settled or compromised for more than $100,000, the Secretary shall certify it to Congress.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 548; Pub. L. 86–533, §1(3)(A), June 29, 1960, 74 Stat. 245; Pub. L. 92–417, §2(a), Aug. 29, 1972, 86 Stat. 655.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §71 (June 15, 1936, ch. 550, 49 Stat. 1514; July 1, 1944, ch. 373, title VII, §711, 58 Stat. 714; Aug. 13, 1946, ch. 958, §5, 60 Stat. 1051).

This section closely parallels title 46, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§797, 798, which authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to negotiate amicable settlement of claims against the United States arising out of the operation of Naval vessels.
It grants similar authority to the Secretary of the Treasury in relation to vessels in the Coast Guard service, and the limiting amount is reduced from $1,000,000 to $25,000. It is believed that this section will work to the benefit of the Government by reducing civil litigation and the number of claims which must presently be certified to Congress for appropriations in order to make settlement.
It will greatly expedite the settlement of just claims and should result in a considerable overall savings to the Government. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§647. Claims for damage to property of the United States

The Secretary may consider, ascertain, adjust, determine, compromise, or settle claims for damage cognizable in admiralty in a district court of the United States and all claims for damage caused by a vessel or floating object, to property of the United States under the jurisdiction of the Coast Guard or property for which the Coast Guard may have assumed, by contract or otherwise, any obligation to respond for damage thereto.
The Secretary is further authorized to receive in payment of any such claim the amount due the United States pursuant to determination, compromise, or settlement as herein authorized and, upon acceptance of such payment but not until then, such determination, settlement, or compromise of such claim shall be final and conclusive for all purposes, any law to the contrary notwithstanding.
All such payments shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States as miscellaneous receipts.
The Secretary is further authorized to execute on behalf of the United States and to deliver in exchange for such payment a full release of such claim.
This section, as respects the determination, compromise, settlement, and payment of claims, shall be supplementary to, and not in lieu of, all other provisions of law authorizing the determination, compromise, or settlement of claims for damage to property hereinabove described.
No settlement or compromise where there is involved a payment in the net amount of over $100,000 is authorized by this section.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 549; Pub. L. 86–533, §1(3)(B), June 29, 1960, 74 Stat. 245; Pub. L. 94–546, §1(34), Oct. 18, 1976, 90 Stat. 2521; Pub. L. 98–557, §17(b)(3)(A), Oct. 30, 1984, 98 Stat. 2868.)

Historical and Revision Notes

This section closely parallels title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§600a, 600b, which authorize the Secretary of the Navy to negotiate amicable settlements of affirmative claims of the United States for damage to Government property.
Experience gained by the Navy since enactment of title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§600a–600d, indicates that such amicable settlement reacts to the benefit of the Government in many cases.
The provisions of this section would complement those of section 646 of this title and the two sections together would permit the Coast Guard to negotiate the settlement of claims arising out of Coast Guard floating operations, both for and against the United States. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§648. Accounting for industrial work

The Secretary may prescribe regulations governing accounting for industrial work, including charges for overhead for civilian labor and for maintenance of industrial plant and equipment, performed at the Coast Guard Yard or such similar Coast Guard industrial establishments as he may designate.
Any orders placed for such industrial work shall be covered by a transfer or advance of funds to cover the estimated cost thereof, and shall be credited to such accounts as may be necessary and established by the Secretary to carry out the provisions of this section.
Accounts so established shall be available for materials, supplies, or equipment, and civilian labor, including overhead and maintenance, required in performing the work ordered.
Upon completion of an order an adjustment will be made to make the amount transferred or advanced equal to the actual cost as computed in accordance with the accounting regulations prescribed by the Secretary.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 549.)

Historical and Revision Notes

This section is intended to eliminate a very cumbersome and inefficient method of accounting for industrial jobs at the Coast Guard Yard and other shore establishments where industrial work may be undertaken.
Under existing law several accounts must be kept current for each job in progress.
Under this statute the working fund would be available for all types of expenditures in connection with a job and the breakdown into separate accounts could be done after the job is complete.
The other armed forces have provisions of law which permit a working fund similar to the one provided by this section. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§649. Supplies and equipment from stock

Supplies and equipment for special work of the Coast Guard may be furnished from general stock and the applicable appropriation reimbursed therefor from the respective appropriations for such special work.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 550.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 33, U.S.C., 1934 ed., §726 (Mar. 4, 1913, ch. 168, 37 Stat. 1018).

Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§650. Coast Guard Supply Fund

(a) A Coast Guard Supply Fund is authorized.
The Secretary may prescribe regulations for designating the classification of materials to be stocked.
In these regulations, whenever the fund is extended to include items not previously stocked, or spare parts obtained as part of a procurement under a different account of major items such as vessels or aircraft, whether or not such parts were previously stocked, the Secretary may authorize an increase in the existing capital of the fund by the value of such usable materials transferred thereto from Coast Guard inventories carried in other accounts.
Except for the materials so transferred, the fund shall be charged with the cost of materials purchased or otherwise acquired.
The fund shall be credited with the value of materials consumed, issued for use, sold, or otherwise disposed of, such values to be determined on a basis that will approximately cover the cost thereof.

(b) Obligations may, without regard to fiscal year limitations, be incurred against anticipated reimbursement to the Coast Guard Supply Fund in such amount and for such period, as the Secretary, with approval of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, may determine to be necessary to maintain stock levels consistently with planned operations for the next year.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 550; Aug. 7, 1956, ch. 1023, §1(a), 70 Stat. 1077; Pub. L. 91–278, §1(13), June 12, 1970, 84 Stat. 306; Pub. L. 94–546, §1(35), Oct. 18, 1976, 90 Stat. 2521; Pub. L. 96–376, §5, Oct. 3, 1980, 94 Stat. 1509.)

Historical and Revision Notes

A Coast Guard supply fund was established by the Naval Appropriation Act for fiscal year 1943 approved February 7, 1942, 56 Stat. 73. Experience has clearly shown that it is advantageous to the Government to have permanent authorization for such a fund. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§651. Annual report

In April of each year, the Commandant, through the Secretary, shall report to Congress the operations and expenditures of the Coast Guard during the preceding fiscal year, including amounts collected as provided under section 664 of this title.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 550; Pub. L. 94–546, §1(36), Oct. 18, 1976, 90 Stat. 2522; Pub. L. 99–509, title V, §5102(a)(2), Oct. 21, 1986, 100 Stat. 1926.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §§36, 37 (Oct. 2, 1888, ch. 1069, 25 Stat. 511; Jan. 28, 1915, ch. 20, §5, 38 Stat. 802).

Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§652. Removing restrictions

Any law removing for the duration of a war or national emergency proclaimed by the President any restriction contained in any then-existing law as applied to the Navy, including, but not limited to, restrictions relating to the manner in which purchases may be made and contracts awarded, fiscal operations, and personnel, shall, in the same manner and to the same extent, remove such restrictions as applied to the Coast Guard.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 550.)

Historical and Revision Notes

This section is new and provides that any law removing for the duration of a war or national emergency any restriction contained in any then-existing law as applied to the Navy shall operate in the same manner to remove such restrictions as applied to the Coast Guard.
Included are restrictions relating to the manner in which purchases may be made and contracts awarded, fiscal operations, and personnel.
This provision is designed to enable the Coast Guard to operate as efficiently as the Navy Department in time of war or during a national emergency and would permit the Coast Guard more effectively to maintain itself in a state of military readiness during periods of emergency.
Since the Coast Guard operates as part of the Navy in time of war, it is essential that its operations be as flexible and as efficient as those of the Department of which it is to be a part.
This section would prevent inadvertent failures specifically to mention the Coast Guard in legislation of the type described in this section from hindering service operations. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§653. Employment of draftsmen and engineers

The Coast Guard may employ temporarily, at the seat of government, draftsmen and engineers for the preparation of plans and specifications for vessels, lighthouses, aids to navigation, and other projects for the Coast Guard that may be authorized or appropriated for by Congress, to be paid from the appropriations applicable to such projects.

(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 550.)

Historical and Revision Notes

Based on title 33, U.S.C., 1946 ed., §716 (June 17, 1910, ch. 301, §9, 36 Stat. 538; July 27, 1939, ch. 388, §1, 53 Stat. 1130).

Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

§654. Public and commercial vessels and other watercraft; sale of fuel, supplies, and services

The Secretary under such regulations as he may prescribe, may sell to public and commercial vessels and other watercraft, such fuel, supplies and furnish such services as may be required to meet the necessities of the vessel or watercraft if such vessel or watercraft is unable—

(1) to procure the fuel, supplies, or services from other sources at its present location; and

(2) to proceed to the nearest port where they may be obtained without endangering the safety of the ship, the health and comfort of its personnel, or the safe condition of the property carried aboard.

Sales under this section shall be at such prices as the Secretary considers reasonable.
Payment will be made on a cash basis or on such other basis as will reasonably assure prompt payment.
Amounts received from such a sale shall, unless otherwise directed by another provision of law, be credited to the current appropriation concerned and are available for the same purposes as that appropriation.

(Added Pub. L. 86–159, §1, Aug. 14, 1959, 73 Stat. 357; amended Pub. L. 89–444, §1(22), June 9, 1966, 80 Stat. 197.)

§655. Arms and ammunition; immunity from taxation

No tax on the sale or transfer of firearms, pistols, revolvers, shells, or cartridges may be imposed on such articles when bought with funds appropriated for the Coast Guard.

(Added Pub. L. 87–526, §1(6), July 10, 1962, 76 Stat. 142; amended Pub. L. 94–546, §1(37), Oct. 18, 1976, 90 Stat. 2522.)

§656. Use of certain appropriated funds

(a) Funds appropriated to or for the use of the Coast Guard for acquisition, construction, and improvement of facilities, for research, development, test, and evaluation; and for the alteration of bridges over the navigable waters shall remain available until expended.

(b) The Secretary may use any funds appropriated to or for the use of the Coast Guard for other construction purposes to restore, repair, or replace facilities that have been damaged or destroyed, including acquisition of sites.

(c) The Secretary may use any funds appropriated to or for the use of the Coast Guard for other construction purposes to acquire, construct, convert, extend, and install at Coast Guard installations and facilities, needed permanent or temporary public works, including the preparation of sites and the furnishing of appurtenances, utilities, and equipment, but excluding the construction of family quarters, costing  not  more  than  $200,000  for  any  one project.

(d) Minor Construction and Improvement.—

(1) In general.—Subject to the reporting requirements set forth in paragraph (2), each fiscal year the Secretary may expend from amounts made available for the operating expenses of the Coast Guard not more than $1,500,000 for minor construction and improvement projects at any location.

(2) Reporting requirements.—Not later than 90 days after the end of each fiscal year, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives a report on each project undertaken during the course of the preceding fiscal year for which the amount expended under paragraph (1) exceeded $500,000.

(b)(1) The Secretary shall make, at least once each year, a computation to determine the number of Reserve officers in an active status authorized to be serving in each grade.
The number in each grade shall be computed by applying the applicable percentage to the total number of such officers serving in an active status on the date the computation is made.
The number of Reserve officers in an active status below the grade of rear admiral (lower half) shall be distributed by pay grade so as not to exceed percentages of commissioned officers authorized by section 42(b) of this title.
When the actual number of Reserve officers in an active status in a particular pay grade is less than the maximum percentage authorized, the difference may be applied to the number in the next lower grade.
A Reserve officer may not be reduced in rank or grade solely because of a reduction in an authorized number as provided for in this subsection, or because an excess results directly from the operation of law.

(2) The authorized number of Reserve Officers in an active status not on active duty in the grades of rear admiral (lower half) and rear admiral is a total of two.

(e) The Secretary shall adjust the date of rank of a Reserve officer so that no changes of precedence occur.

An officer who has twice failed of selection or who has been considered but has not been recommended for continuation under section 289 of this title shall not be assigned as a running mate under this section.

(1) If a previously assigned running mate is promoted from below the promotion zone, is removed from the active duty promotion list, suffers a loss of numbers, fails of selection, fails to qualify for promotion, or declines an appointment after being selected for promotion, the new running mate shall be that officer on the active duty promotion list, of the same grade, who is next senior to the previous running mate and who is, or may become, eligible for consideration for promotion.
If the previous running mate was on a list of selectees for promotion, the new running mate shall be that officer on the active duty promotion list, of the same grade, who is on a list of selectees for promotion and who is next senior to the previous running mate.

(2) If a Reserve officer suffers a loss of numbers, the new running mate shall be that officer on the active duty promotion list who, after the loss of numbers has been effected, is the running mate of the Reserve officer next senior to the Reserve officer concerned.

(3) If a Reserve officer is considered for promotion and fails of selection, fails to qualify for promotion, declines an appointment after being selected for promotion, or has his or her name removed from a list of selectees for promotion, and that officer's running mate is promoted, the new running mate shall be that officer on the active duty promotion list, of the same grade, who, at the time the previous running mate was considered for promotion, was next senior to the previous running mate, was eligible for consideration for promotion, and whose name was not included on a list of selectees for promotion.

(4) In a situation not expressly covered by this subsection, the Secretary may assign a new running mate as necessary to effect the intent of this section that inequitable changes of precedence do not occur.

(c) A Reserve officer on the active duty promotion list shall, to the extent practicable and consistent with the limitations imposed by this section, be assigned as the running mate of all Reserve officers junior to the officer, who are in an active status not on the active duty promotion list, and who had a running mate in common with the officer just prior to the time the officer was placed on the active duty promotion list.

(d) The Secretary may adjust, as necessary, the date of rank of a Reserve officer not on active duty so that the date will correspond with that of the running mate assigned to the officer in accordance with this section.
If an overpayment of pay or allowances results from adjusting the date of rank, the overpayment is not subject to recoupment.
