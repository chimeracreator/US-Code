(b) It is hereby declared to be in the national interest to accelerate the construction of the Federal-aid highway systems, including The Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways, since many of such highways, or portions thereof, are in fact inadequate to meet the needs of local and interstate commerce, for the national and civil defense.

It is hereby declared that the prompt and early completion of The Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways, so named because of its primary importance to the national defense and hereafter referred to as the “Interstate System”, is essential to the national interest and is one of the most important objectives of this Act.
It is the intent of Congress that the Interstate System be completed as nearly as practicable over the period of availability of the forty years’ appropriations authorized for the purpose of expediting its construction, reconstruction, or improvement, inclusive of necessary tunnels and bridges, through the fiscal year ending September 30, 1996, under section 108(b) of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 (70 Stat. 374), and that the entire system in all States be brought to simultaneous completion.
Insofar as possible in consonance with this objective, existing highways located on an interstate route shall be used to the extent that such use is practicable, suitable, and feasible, it being the intent that local needs, to the extent practicable, suitable, and feasible, shall be given equal consideration with the needs of interstate commerce.

It is further declared that since the Interstate System is now in the final phase of completion it shall be the national policy that increased emphasis be placed on the construction and reconstruction of the other Federal-aid systems in accordance with the first paragraph of this subsection, in order to bring all of the Federal-aid systems up to standards and to increase the safety of these systems to the maximum extent.

(c) It is the sense of Congress that under existing law no part of any sums authorized to be appropriated for expenditure upon any Federal-aid system which has been apportioned pursuant to the provisions of this title shall be impounded or withheld from obligation, for purposes and projects as provided in this title, by any officer or employee in the executive branch of the Federal Government, except such specific sums as may be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, are necessary to be withheld from obligation for specific periods of time to assure that sufficient amounts will be available in the Highway Trust Fund to defray the expenditures which will be required to be made from such fund.

(d) No funds authorized to be appropriated from the Highway Trust Fund shall be expended by or on behalf of any Federal department, agency, or instrumentality other than the Federal Highway Administration unless funds for such expenditure are identified and included as a line item in an appropriation Act and are to meet obligations of the United States heretofore or hereafter incurred under this title attributable to the construction of Federal-aid highways or highway planning, research, or development, or as otherwise specifically authorized to be appropriated from the Highway Trust Fund by Federal-aid highway legislation.

(e) It is the national policy that to the maximum extent possible the procedures to be utilized by the Secretary and all other affected heads of Federal departments, agencies, and instrumentalities for carrying out this title and any other provision of law relating to the Federal highway programs shall encourage the substantial minimization of paperwork and interagency decision procedures and the best use of available manpower and funds so as to prevent needless duplication and unnecessary delays at all levels of government.

§104. Apportionment

(a) Whenever an apportionment is made of the sums authorized to be appropriated for expenditure on the surface transportation program, the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program, the National Highway System, and the Interstate System, the Secretary shall deduct a sum, in such amount not to exceed 33/4 per centum of all sums so authorized as the Secretary may deem necessary for administering the provisions of law to be financed from appropriations for the Federal-aid systems and for carrying on the research authorized by subsections (a) and (b) of section 307 of this title.
In making such determination, the Secretary shall take into account the unexpended balance of any sums deducted for such purposes in prior years.
The sum so deducted shall be available for expenditure from the unexpended balance of any appropriation made at any time for expenditure upon the Federal-aid systems, until such sum has been expended.

(b) On October 1, of each fiscal year except as provided in paragraph (5)(A) of this subsection, the Secretary, after making the deduction authorized by subsection (a) of this section and the set asides authorized by subsection (f) of this section and section 307 of this title, shall apportion the remainder of the sums authorized to be appropriated for expenditure on the surface transportation program, the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program, the National Highway System, and the Interstate System for that fiscal year, among the several States in the following manner:

(1) National highway system.—For the National Highway System 1 percent to the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands and the remaining 99 percent apportioned in the same ratio as funds are apportioned under paragraph (3).

(2) Congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program.—For the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program, in the ratio which the weighted nonattainment area population of each State bears to the total weighted nonattainment area population of all States.
The weighted nonattainment area population shall be calculated by multiplying the population of each area within any State that was a nonattainment area (as defined in section 171(2) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7501(2))) for ozone during any part of fiscal year 1994 by a factor of—

(A) 1.0 if the area is classified as a marginal ozone nonattainment area under subpart 2 of part D of title I of the Clean Air Act;

(B) 1.1 if the area is classified as a moderate ozone nonattainment area under such subpart;

(C) 1.2 if the area is classified as a serious ozone nonattainment area under such subpart;

(D) 1.3 if the area is classified as a severe ozone nonattainment area under such subpart; or

(E) 1.4 if the area is classified as an extreme ozone nonattainment area under such subpart.

If the area was also classified under subpart 3 of part D of title I of such Act as a nonattainment area for carbon monoxide during any part of fiscal year 1994, for purposes of calculating the weighted nonattainment area population, the weighted nonattainment area population of the area, as determined under the preceding provisions of this paragraph, shall be further multiplied by a factor of 1.2. Notwithstanding any provision of this paragraph, in the case of States with a total 1990 census population of 15,000,000 or greater, the amount apportioned under this paragraph in a fiscal year to all of such States in the aggregate, shall be distributed among such States based on their relative populations; except that none of such States shall be distributed more than 42 percent of the aggregate amount so apportioned to all of such States.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, each State shall receive a minimum apportionment of 1/2 of 1 percent of the funds apportioned under this paragraph.
The Secretary shall use estimates prepared by the Secretary of Commerce when determining population figures.

(3) Surface transportation program.—

(A) General rule.—For the surface transportation program in a manner so that a State's current percentage share of apportionments is equal to the State's 1987–1991 percentage share of apportionments.
For purposes of this paragraph—

(i) a State's current percentage share of apportionments is the State's percentage share of all funds apportioned for a fiscal year under paragraph (1) for the National Highway System, under section 144 for the bridge program, under paragraph (5)(B) for Interstate maintenance, and under this paragraph; and

(ii) a State's 1987–1991 percentage share of apportionments is the State's percentage share of all apportionments and allocations under this title for fiscal years 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991 (except apportionments and allocations for Interstate construction under sections 104(b)(5)(A) and 118, Interstate highway substitute under section 103(e)(4), Federal lands highways under section 202, and emergency relief under section 125, all allocations under section 149 of the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987, and the portion of allocations under section 157 (relating to minimum allocation) that would be attributable to apportionments made under Interstate construction and Interstate highway substitute programs under sections 104(b)(5)(A) and 103(e)(4), respectively, for such fiscal years if the minimum allocation percentage for such fiscal years had been 90 percent instead of 85 percent).

(B) Calculation rules.—In calculating a State's percentage share under this paragraph for the purpose of making apportionments for fiscal years 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997, each State shall be treated as having received 1/2 of 1 percent of all funds apportioned for the Interstate construction program under section 104(b)(5)(A) in fiscal years 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991. Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, in any fiscal year no State shall receive a percentage of total apportionments and allocations that is less than 70 percent of its percentage of total apportionments and allocations for fiscal years 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991, except for those States that receive an apportionment for Interstate construction under paragraph (5)(A) of more than $50,000,000 for fiscal year 1992.

(4) For the Interstate System, for the fiscal years ending June 30, 1957, June 30, 1958, and June 30, 1959:

One-half in the ratio which the population of each State bears to the total population of all the States as shown by the latest available Federal census, except that no States shall receive less than three-fourths of 1 per centum of the funds so apportioned; and one-half in the manner provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection.
The sums authorized by section 108(b) of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 for the fiscal years ending June 30, 1958, and June 30, 1959, shall be apportioned on a date not less than six months and not more than twelve months in advance of the beginning of the fiscal year for which authorized.

(5)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B)—For the Interstate System for the fiscal years 1960 through 1996:

For the fiscal years 1960 through 1966, in the ratio which the estimated cost of completing the Interstate System in such State, as determined and approved in the manner provided in this paragraph, bears to the sum of the estimated cost of completing the Interstate System in all of the States.
For the fiscal years 1967 through 1990, in the ratio which the Federal share of the estimated cost of completing the Interstate System in such State, as determined and approved in the manner provided in this paragraph, bears to the sum of the estimated cost of the Federal share of completing the Interstate System in all of the States.
Each apportionment herein authorized for the fiscal years 1960 through 1996, inclusive, shall be made on October 1 of the year preceding the fiscal year for which authorized.
As soon as the standards provided for in subsection (b) of section 109 of this title have been adopted, the Secretary, in cooperation with the State highway departments, shall make a detailed estimate of the cost of completing the Interstate System as then designated, after taking into account all previous apportionments made under this section, based upon such standards and in accordance with rules and regulations adopted by him and applied uniformly to all of the States.

55 per centum in the ratio that lane miles on the Interstate routes designated under sections 103 and 139(c) of this title and routes on the Interstate System designated under section 139(a) of this title before March 9, 1984,2 (other than those on toll roads not subject to a Secretarial agreement provided for in section 105 of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1978) in each State bears to the total of all such lane miles in all States; and 45 per centum in the ratio that vehicle miles traveled on lanes on the Interstate routes designated under sections 103 and 139(c) of this title and routes on the Interstate System designated under section 139(a) of this title before March 9, 1984,2 (other than those on toll roads not subject to a Secretarial agreement provided for in section 105 of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1978) in each State bears to the total of all such vehicle miles in all States.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, no State excluding any State that has no interstate lane miles shall receive less than one-half of 1 per centum of the total apportionment made by this subparagraph for any fiscal year.

(6) For the Federal-aid urban systems:

In the ratio which the population in urban areas, or parts thereof, in each State bears to the total population in such urban areas, or parts thereof, in all the States as shown by the latest available Federal census.
No State shall receive less than one-half of 1 per centum of each year's apportionment.

(c) Transferability of NHS Apportionments.—A State may transfer not to exceed 50 percent of the State's apportionment under subsection (b)(1) to the apportionment of the State under subsection (b)(3). A State may transfer not to exceed 100 percent of the State's apportionment under subsection (b)(1) to the apportionment of the State under subsection (b)(3) if the State requests to make such transfer and the Secretary approves such transfer as being in the public interest, after providing notice and sufficient opportunity for public comment.
Section 133(d) shall not apply to funds transferred under this subsection.

(d) Operation Lifesaver and High Speed Rail Corridors.—

(1) Operation lifesaver.—The Secretary shall expend, from administrative funds deducted under subsection (a), $300,000 for each fiscal year for carrying out a public information and education program to help prevent and reduce motor vehicle accidents, injuries, and fatalities and to improve driver performance at railway-highway crossings.

(2) Railway-highway crossing hazard elimination in high speed rail corridors.—(A) Before making an apportionment of funds under subsection (b)(3) for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall set aside $5,000,000 of the funds authorized to be appropriated for the surface transportation program for such fiscal year for elimination of hazards of railway-highway crossings in not to exceed 5 railway corridors selected by the Secretary in accordance with the criteria set forth in this paragraph.

(B) A corridor selected by the Secretary under subparagraph (A) must include rail lines where railroad speeds of 90 miles per hour are occurring or can reasonably be expected to occur in the future.

(3) In making the determination required by paragraph (2)(A), the Secretary shall consider projected rail ridership volumes in such corridors, the percentage of the corridor over which a train will be capable of operating at its maximum cruise speed taking into account such factors as topography and other traffic on the line, projected benefits to nonriders such as congestion relief on other modes of transportation serving the corridors (including congestion in heavily traveled air passenger corridors), the amount of State and local financial support that can reasonably be anticipated for the improvement of the line and related facilities, and the cooperation of the owner of the right-of-way that can reasonably be expected in the operation of high speed rail passenger service in such corridors.

(e) On October 1, of each fiscal year the Secretary shall certify to each of the State highway departments the sums which he has apportioned hereunder (other than under subsection (b)(5) of this section) to each State for such fiscal year, and also the sums which he has deducted for administration and research pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.
On October 1 of the year preceding the fiscal year for which authorized, the Secretary shall certify to each of the State highway departments the sums which he has apportioned under subsection (b)(5) of this section to each State for such fiscal year, and also the sums which he has deducted for administration and research pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.
To permit the States to develop adequate plans for the utilization of apportioned sums, the Secretary shall advise each State of the amount that will be apportioned each year under this section not later than ninety days before the beginning of the fiscal year for which the sums to be apportioned are authorized, except that in the case of the Interstate System the Secretary shall advise each State ninety days prior to the apportionment of such funds.

(f)(1) On October 1 of each fiscal year, the Secretary, after making the deduction authorized by subsection (a) of this section, shall set aside not to exceed 1 percent of the remaining funds authorized to be appropriated for expenditure upon programs authorized under this title, for the purpose of carrying out the requirements of section 134 of this title, except that the amount from which such set aside is made shall not include funds authorized to be appropriated for the Interstate construction and Interstate substitute programs.

(2) These funds shall be apportioned to the States in the ratio which the population in urbanized areas or parts thereof, in each State bears to the total population in such urbanized areas in all the States as shown by the latest available census, except that no State shall receive less than one-half per centum of the amount apportioned.

(3) The funds apportioned to any State under paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be made available by the State to the metropolitan planning organizations responsible for carrying out the provisions of section 134 of this title, except that States receiving the minimum apportionment under paragraph (2) may, in addition, subject to the approval of the Secretary, use the funds apportioned to finance transportation planning outside of urbanized areas.
These funds shall be matched in accordance with section 120(j) 3 of this title unless the Secretary determines that the interests of the Federal-aid highway program would be best served without such matching.

(4) The distribution within any State of the planning funds made available to agencies under paragraph (3) of this subsection shall be in accordance with a formula developed by each State and approved by the Secretary which shall consider but not necessarily be limited to, population, status of planning, attainment of air quality standards, metropolitan area transportation needs, and other factors necessary to provide for an appropriate distribution of funds to carry out the requirements of section 134 and other applicable requirements of Federal law.

(5) Determination of population figures.—For the purposes of determining population figures under this subsection, the Secretary shall use the most recent estimate published by the Secretary of Commerce.

(g) Not more than 40 per centum of the amount apportioned in any fiscal year to each State in accordance with sections 130, 144, and 152 of this title may be transferred from the apportionment under one section to the apportionment under any other of such sections if such a transfer is requested by the State highway department and is approved by the Secretary as being in the public interest.
The Secretary may approve the transfer of 100 per centum of the apportionment under one such section to the apportionment under any other of such sections if such transfer is requested by the State highway department, and is approved by the Secretary as being in the public interest, if he has received satisfactory assurances from such State highway department that the purposes of the program from which such funds are to be transferred have been met.
A State may transfer not to exceed 50 percent of the State's apportionment under section 144 in any fiscal year to the apportionment of such State under subsection (b)(1) or subsection (b)(3) of this section.
Any transfer to subsection (b)(3) shall not be subject to section 133(d). Nothing in this subsection authorizes the transfer of any amount apportioned from the Highway Trust Fund to any apportionment the funds for which were not from the Highway Trust Fund, and nothing in this subsection authorizes the transfer of any amount apportioned from funds not from the Highway Trust Fund to any apportionment the funds for which were from the Highway Trust Fund.

(h) National Recreational Trails Funding.—In addition to funds made available from the National Recreational Trails Trust Fund, the Secretary shall obligate, from administrative funds (contract authority) deducted under subsection (a), to carry out section 1302 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (16 U.S.C. 1261) $15,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1996 and 1997 and $7,500,000 for the period of October 1, 1997, through March 31, 1998.

(2) Federal share.—The Federal share of the cost of any project funded with amounts expended under paragraph (1) shall be 100 percent.

(j) The Secretary shall submit to Congress not later than the 20th day of each calendar month which begins after the date of enactment of this subsection a report on (1) the amount of obligation, by State, for Federal-aid highways and the highway safety construction programs during the preceding calendar month, (2) the cumulative amount of obligation, by State, for that fiscal year, (3) the balance as of the last day of such preceding month of the unobligated apportionment of each State by fiscal year, and (4) the balance of unobligated sums available for expenditure at the discretion of the Secretary for such highways and programs for that fiscal year.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no State shall receive for any such fiscal year less than one-half of 1 per centum of the total apportionment under this section for such fiscal year.
For purposes of this paragraph and subsection (b) of section 103 of title 23, United States Code, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands shall be considered together as one State.
The State consisting of the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Mariana Islands shall not receive less than one-half of 1 per centum of each year's apportionment.
There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary out of the Highway Trust Fund to carry out this subsection.
Funds authorized by this subsection shall be available for obligation in the same manner and to the same extent as if such funds were apportioned under chapter 1 of title 23, United States Code.

(3) Bond interest.—Subject to the provisions of this paragraph, the cost of construction of a project, the Federal share of which the Secretary is authorized to pay under this subsection, shall include the amount of any interest earned and payable on bonds issued by the State to the extent that the proceeds of such bonds have actually been expended in the construction of such project.
In no event shall the amount of interest considered as a cost of construction of a project under the preceding sentence be greater than the excess of (A) the amount which would be the estimated cost of construction of the project if the project were to be constructed at the time the project is converted to a regularly funded project, over (B) the actual cost of construction of such project (not including such interest). The Secretary shall consider changes in construction cost indices in determining the amount under clause (A) of this paragraph.

(c) Completion of Projects.—In determining the apportionment for any fiscal year under the provisions of section 103(e)(4), 104, 134, 144,,1 or 307 of this title, any such project constructed by a State without the aid of Federal funds shall not be considered completed until an application under the provisions of this section with respect to such project has been approved by the Secretary.

§116. Maintenance

(a) It shall be the duty of the State highway department to maintain, or cause to be maintained, any project constructed under the provisions of this chapter or constructed under the provisions of prior Acts.
The State's obligation to the United States to maintain any such project shall cease when it no longer constitutes a part of a Federal-aid system.

(b) In any State wherein the State highway department is without legal authority to maintain a project constructed on the Federal-aid secondary system, or within a municipality, such highway department shall enter into a formal agreement for its maintenance with the appropriate officials of the county or municipality in which such project is located.

(c) If at any time the Secretary shall find that any project constructed under the provisions of this chapter or constructed under the provisions of prior Acts, is not being properly maintained, he shall call such fact to the attention of the State highway department.
If, within ninety days after receipt of such notice, such project has not been put in proper condition of maintenance, the Secretary shall withhold approval of further projects of all types in the State highway district, municipality, county, other political or administrative subdivision of the State, or the entire State in which such project is located, whichever the Secretary deems most appropriate, until such project shall have been put in proper condition of maintenance.

(d) Preventive Maintenance.—A preventive maintenance activity shall be eligible for Federal assistance under this title if the State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the activity is a cost-effective means of extending the useful life of a Federal-aid highway.

Sums authorized to be appropriated for this section shall be out of the Highway Trust Fund and shall be apportioned in accordance with section 104(b)(5)(B) of this title.

(b) Not later than one year after the date of issuance of initial guidelines under section 109(m) of this title each State shall have a program for the Interstate system 1 in accordance with such guidelines.
Each State shall certify on January 1st of each year that it has such a program and the Interstate system 1 is maintained in accordance with that program.
If a State fails to certify as required or if the Secretary determines a State is not adequately maintaining the Interstate system 1 in accordance with such program then the next apportionment of funds to such State for the Interstate system 1 shall be reduced by amounts equal to 10 per centum of the amount which would otherwise be apportioned to such State under section 104 of this title.
If, within one year from the date the apportionment for a State is reduced under this subsection, the Secretary determines that such State is maintaining the Interstate system 1 in accordance with the guidelines the apportionment of such State shall be increased by an amount equal to the reduction.
If the Secretary does not make such a determination within such one year period the amount so withheld shall be reapportioned to all other eligible States.

(c) Eligible Activities.—Activities authorized in subsection (a) may include the reconstruction of bridges, interchanges, and over crossings along existing Interstate routes, including the acquisition of right-of-way where necessary, but shall not include the construction of new travel lanes other than high occupancy vehicle lanes or auxiliary lanes.

(d) Transfer of Interstate Construction Apportionments.—Upon application by a State (other than the State of Massachusetts) and approval by the Secretary, the Secretary may transfer to the apportionments to such State under section 104(b)(1) or 104(b)(5)(B) any amount of the funds apportioned to such State for any fiscal year under section 104(b)(5)(A) if such amount does not exceed the Federal share of the costs of construction of segments of the Interstate System open to traffic in such State (other than high occupancy vehicle lanes) included in the most recent interstate cost estimate.
Upon transfer of such amount, the construction on which such amount is based on open-to-traffic segments of the Interstate System in such State as included in the latest interstate cost estimate shall be ineligible and shall not be included in future interstate cost estimates approved or adjusted under section 104(b)(5)(A).

(e) Preventive Maintenance.—Preventive maintenance activities shall be eligible under this section when a State can demonstrate, through its pavement management system, that such activities are a cost-effective means of extending Interstate pavement life.

(f) Transfer of Funds for Surface Transportation Program Projects.—

(1) Upon certification acceptance.—If a State certifies to the Secretary that any part of the sums apportioned to the State under section 104(b)(5)(B) of this title are in excess of the needs of the State for resurfacing, restoring, or rehabilitating Interstate System routes and the State is adequately maintaining the Interstate System and the Secretary accepts such certification, the State may transfer such excess part to its apportionment under sections 104(b)(1) and 104(b)(3).

(2) Unconditional.—Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a State may transfer to its apportionment under sections 104(b)(1) and 104(b)(3) of this title—

(A) in fiscal year 1987, an amount not to exceed 20 percent of the funds apportioned to the State under section 104(b)(5)(B) which are not obligated at the time of the transfer; and

(B) in any fiscal year thereafter, an amount not to exceed 20 percent of the funds apportioned to the State under section 104(b)(5)(B) for such fiscal year.

(g) Limitation on New Capacity.—Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, the portion of the cost of any project undertaken pursuant to this section that is attributable to the expansion of the capacity of any Interstate highway or bridge, where such new capacity consists of one or more new travel lanes that are not high-occupancy vehicle lanes or auxiliary lanes, shall not be eligible for funding under this section.

§120. Federal share payable

(a) Interstate System Projects.—Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the Federal share payable on account of any project on the Interstate System (including a project to add high occupancy vehicle lanes and a project to add auxiliary lanes but excluding a project to add any other lanes) shall be 90 percent of the total cost thereof, plus a percentage of the remaining 10 percent of such cost in any State containing unappropriated and unreserved public lands and nontaxable Indian lands, individual and tribal, exceeding 5 percent of the total area of all lands therein, equal to the percentage that the area of such lands in such State is of its total area; except that such Federal share payable on any project in any State shall not exceed 95 percent of the total cost of such project.

(b) Other Projects.—Except as otherwise provided in this title, the Federal share payable on account of any project or activity carried out under this title (other than a project subject to subsection (a)) shall be—

(1) 80 percent of the cost thereof, except that in the case of any State containing nontaxable Indian lands, individual and tribal, and public domain lands (both reserved and unreserved) exclusive of national forests and national parks and monuments, exceeding 5 percent of the total area of all lands therein, the Federal share, for purposes of this chapter, shall be increased by a percentage of the remaining cost equal to the percentage that the area of all such lands in such State, is of its total area; or

(2) 80 percent of the cost thereof, except that in the case of any State containing nontaxable Indian lands, individual and tribal, public domain lands (both reserved and unreserved), national forests, and national parks and monuments, the Federal share, for purposes of this chapter, shall be increased by a percentage of the remaining cost equal to the percentage that the area of all such lands in such State is of its total area;

except that the Federal share payable on any project in a State shall not exceed 95 percent of the total cost of any such project.
In any case where a State elects to have the Federal share provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the State must enter into an agreement with the Secretary covering a period of not less than 1 year, requiring such State to use solely for purposes eligible for assistance under this title (other than paying its share of projects approved under this title) during the period covered by such agreement the difference between the State's share as provided in paragraph (2) and what its share would be if it elected to pay the share provided in paragraph (1) for all projects subject to such agreement.

(c) Increased Federal Share for Certain Safety Projects.—The Federal share payable on account of any project for traffic control signalization, safety rest areas, pavement marking, commuter carpooling and vanpooling, rail-highway crossing closure, or installation of traffic signs, traffic lights, guardrails, impact attenuators, concrete barrier endtreatments, breakaway utility poles, or priority control systems for emergency vehicles at signalized intersections may amount to 100 percent of the cost of construction of such projects; except that not more than 10 percent of all sums apportioned for all the Federal-aid systems for any fiscal year in accordance with section 104 of this title shall be used under this subsection.
In this subsection, the term “safety rest area” means an area where motor vehicle operators can park their vehicles and rest, where food, fuel, and lodging services are not available, and that is located on a segment of highway with respect to which the Secretary determines there is a shortage of public and private areas at which motor vehicle operators can park their vehicles and rest.

The sums so advanced shall be deposited in a special revolving trust fund, by the State official authorized under the laws of the State to receive Federal-aid highway funds, to be disbursed solely upon vouchers approved by the State highway department for rights-of-way which have been or are being acquired, and for construction which has been actually performed and approved by the Secretary pursuant to this chapter.
Upon determination by the Secretary that any part of the funds advanced to any State under the provisions of this section are no longer required, the amount of the advance, which is determined to be in excess of current requirements of the State, shall be repaid upon his demand, and such repayments shall be returned to the credit of the appropriation from which the funds were advanced.
Any sum advanced and not repaid on demand shall be deducted from sums due the State for the Federal pro rata share of the cost of construction of Federal-aid projects.

(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, if the Secretary of Transportation determines that any toll bridge, toll tunnel, or approach thereto, which meets the requirements of section 129 of this title is necessary to complete an essential gap in the Interstate System then, upon request of the State highway department, the Secretary shall, at any time during construction of such bridge, tunnel, or approach and for one year after it is opened to traffic, and subject to the conditions and limitations of such section 129, advance to such State 100 per centum of the cost of construction of such bridge, tunnel, or approach.

Any advance made to a State under this subsection shall be from the funds apportioned to said State for the Interstate System.
So much of any advance made to a State under this subsection required to be repaid shall be repaid with interest at a rate determined by the Secretary.
If a State receives any advance under this subsection with respect to any toll bridge, tunnel, or approach thereto, then the provisions of section 103(e)(4) of this title shall not apply to such bridge, tunnel, or approach.

§127. Vehicle weight limitations—Interstate System

(a) In General.—No funds shall be apportioned in any fiscal year under section 104(b)(1) of this title to any State which does not permit the use of The Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways within its boundaries by vehicles with a weight of twenty thousand pounds carried on any one axle, including enforcement tolerances, or with a tandem axle weight of thirty-four thousand pounds, including enforcement tolerances, or a gross weight of at least eighty thousand pounds for vehicle combinations of five axles or more.
However, the maximum gross weight to be allowed by any State for vehicles using The Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways shall be twenty thousand pounds carried on one axle, including enforcement tolerances, and a tandem axle weight of thirty-four thousand pounds, including enforcement tolerances and with an overall maximum gross weight, including enforcement tolerances, on a group of two or more consecutive axles produced by application of the following formula:

LN

W=500 (__________+12N+36)

N−1

where W equals overall gross weight on any group of two or more consecutive axles to the nearest five hundred pounds, L equals distance in feet between the extreme of any group of two or more consecutive axles, and N equals number of axles in group under consideration, except that two consecutive sets of tandem axles may carry a gross load of thirty-four thousand pounds each providing the overall distance between the first and last axles of such consecutive sets of tandem axles (1) is thirty-six feet or more, or (2) in the case of a motor vehicle hauling any tank trailer, dump trailer, or ocean transport container before September 1, 1989, is 30 feet or more: Provided, That such overall gross weight may not exceed eighty thousand pounds, including all enforcement tolerances, except for vehicles using Interstate Route 29 between Sioux City, Iowa, and the border between Iowa and South Dakota or vehicles using Interstate Route 129 between Sioux City, Iowa, and the border between Iowa and Nebraska, and except for those vehicles and loads which cannot be easily dismantled or divided and which have been issued special permits in accordance with applicable State laws, or the corresponding maximum weights permitted for vehicles using the public highways of such State under laws or regulations established by appropriate State authority in effect on July 1, 1956, except in the case of the overall gross weight of any group of two or more consecutive axles on any vehicle (other than a vehicle comprised of a motor vehicle hauling any tank trailer, dump trailer, or ocean transport container on or after September 1, 1989), on the date of enactment of the Federal-Aid Highway Amendments of 1974, whichever is the greater.
Any amount which is withheld from apportionment to any State pursuant to the foregoing provisions shall lapse if not released and obligated within the availability period specified in section 118(b)(1) 1 of this title.
This section shall not be construed to deny apportionment to any State allowing the operation within such State of any vehicles or combinations thereof, other than vehicles or combinations subject to subsection (d) of this section, which the State determines could be lawfully operated within such State on July 1, 1956, except in the case of the overall gross weight of any group of two or more consecutive axles, on the date of enactment of the Federal-Aid Highway Amendments of 1974. With respect to the State of Hawaii, laws or regulations in effect on February 1, 1960, shall be applicable for the purposes of this section in lieu of those in effect on July 1, 1956. With respect to the State of Michigan, laws or regulations in effect on May 1, 1982, shall be applicable for the purposes of this subsection.

§130. Railway-highway crossings

(a) Except as provided in subsection (d) 1 of section 120 of this title and subsection (b) of this section, the entire cost of construction of projects for the elimination of hazards of railway-highway crossings, including the separation or protection of grades at crossings, the reconstruction of existing railroad grade crossing structures, and the relocation of highways to eliminate grade crossings, may be paid from sums apportioned in accordance with section 104 of this title.
In any case when the elimination of the hazards of a railway-highway crossing can be effected by the relocation of a portion of a railway at a cost estimated by the Secretary to be less than the cost of such elimination by one of the methods mentioned in the first sentence of this section, then the entire cost of such relocation project, except as provided in subsection (d) 1 of section 120 of this title and subsection (b) of this section, may be paid from sums apportioned in accordance with section 104 of this title.

(b) The Secretary may classify the various types of projects involved in the elimination of hazards of railway-highway crossings, and may set for each such classification a percentage of the costs of construction which shall be deemed to represent the net benefit to the railroad or railroads for the purpose of determining the railroad's share of the cost of construction.
The percentage so determined shall in no case exceed 10 per centum.
The Secretary shall determine the appropriate classification of each project.

(c) Any railroad involved in a project for the elimination of hazards of railway-highway crossings paid for in whole or in part from sums made available for expenditure under this title, or prior Acts, shall be liable to the United States for the net benefit to the railroad determined under the classification of such project made pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.
Such liability to the United States may be discharged by direct payment to the State highway department of the State in which the project is located, in which case such payment shall be credited to the cost of the project.
Such payment may consist in whole or in part of materials and labor furnished by the railroad in connection with the construction of such project.
If any such railroad fails to discharge such liability within a six-month period after completion of the project, it shall be liable to the United States for its share of the cost, and the Secretary shall request the Attorney General to institute proceedings against such railroad for the recovery of the amount for which it is liable under this subsection.
The Attorney General is authorized to bring such proceedings on behalf of the United States, in the appropriate district court of the United States, and the United States shall be entitled in such proceedings to recover such sums as it is considered and adjudged by the court that such railroad is liable for in the premises.
Any amounts recovered by the United States under this subsection shall be credited to miscellaneous receipts.

(d) Survey and Schedule of Projects.—Each State shall conduct and systematically maintain a survey of all highways to identify those railroad crossings which may require separation, relocation, or protective devices, and establish and implement a schedule of projects for this purpose.
At a minimum, such a schedule shall provide signs for all railway-highway crossings.

(e) Funds for Protective Devices.—At least 1/2 of the funds authorized for and expended under this section shall be available for the installation of protective devices at railway-highway crossings.
Sums authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section shall be available for obligation in the same manner as funds apportioned under section 104(b)(1) of this title.

(f) Apportionment.—Twenty-five percent of the funds authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section shall be apportioned to the States in the same manner as sums are apportioned under section 104(b)(2) of this title, 25 percent of such funds shall be apportioned to the States in the same manner as sums are apportioned under section 104(b)(6) of this title, and 50 percent of such funds shall be apportioned to the States in the ratio that total railway-highway crossings in each State bears to the total of such crossings in all States.
The Federal share payable on account of any project financed with funds authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section shall be 90 percent of the cost thereof.

(g) Annual Report.—Each State shall report to the Secretary not later than December 30 of each year on the progress being made to implement the railway-highway crossings program authorized by this section and the effectiveness of such improvements.
Each State report shall contain an assessment of the costs of the various treatments employed and subsequent accident experience at improved locations.
The Secretary shall submit a report to the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives not later than April 1 of each year, on the progress being made by the State in implementing projects to improve railway-highway crossings.
The report shall include, but not be limited to, the number of projects undertaken, their distribution by cost range, road system, nature of treatment, and subsequent accident experience at improved locations.
In addition, the Secretary's report shall analyze and evaluate each State program, identify any State found not to be in compliance with the schedule of improvements required by subsection (d) and include recommendations for future implementation of the railroad highway 2 crossings program.

(h) Use of Funds for Matching.—Funds authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section may be used to provide a local government with funds to be used on a matching basis when State funds are available which may only be spent when the local government produces matching funds for the improvement of railway-highway crossings.

(i) Incentive Payments for At-Grade Crossing Closures.—

(1) In general.—Notwithstanding any other provision of this section and subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), a State may, from sums available to the State under this section, make incentive payments to local governments in the State upon the permanent closure by such governments of public at-grade railway-highway crossings under the jurisdiction of such governments.

(2) Incentive payments by railroads.—A State may not make an incentive payment under paragraph (1) to a local government with respect to the closure of a crossing unless the railroad owning the tracks on which the crossing is located makes an incentive payment to the government with respect to the closure.

(3) Amount of state payment.—The amount of the incentive payment payable to a local government by a State under paragraph (1) with respect to a crossing may not exceed the lesser of—

(A) the amount of the incentive payment paid to the government with respect to the crossing by the railroad concerned under paragraph (2); or

(B) $7,500.

(4) Use of state payments.—A local government receiving an incentive payment from a State under paragraph (1) shall use the amount of the incentive payment for transportation safety improvements.

§131. Control of outdoor advertising

(a) The Congress hereby finds and declares that the erection and maintenance of outdoor advertising signs, displays, and devices in areas adjacent to the Interstate System and the primary system should be controlled in order to protect the public investment in such highways, to promote the safety and recreational value of public travel, and to preserve natural beauty.

(b) Federal-aid highway funds apportioned on or after January 1, 1968, to any State which the Secretary determines has not made provision for effective control of the erection and maintenance along the Interstate System and the primary system of outdoor advertising signs, displays, and devices which are within six hundred and sixty feet of the nearest edge of the right-of-way and visible from the main traveled way of the system, and Federal-aid highway funds apportioned on or after January 1, 1975, or after the expiration of the next regular session of the State legislature, whichever is later, to any State which the Secretary determines has not made provision for effective control of the erection and maintenance along the Interstate System and the primary system of those additional outdoor advertising signs, displays, and devices which are more than six hundred and sixty feet off the nearest edge of the right-of-way, located outside of urban areas, visible from the main traveled way of the system, and erected with the purpose of their message being read from such main traveled way, shall be reduced by amounts equal to 10 per centum of the amounts which would otherwise be apportioned to such State under section 104 of this title, until such time as such State shall provide for such effective control.
Any amount which is withheld from apportionment to any State hereunder shall be reapportioned to the other States.
Whenever he determines it to be in the public interest, the Secretary may suspend, for such periods as he deems necessary, the application of this subsection to a State.

(c) Effective control means that such signs, displays, or devices after January 1, 1968, if located within six hundred and sixty feet of the right-of-way and, on or after July 1, 1975, or after the expiration of the next regular session of the State legislature, whichever is later, if located beyond six hundred and sixty feet of the right-of-way located outside of urban areas, visible from the main traveled way of the system, and erected with the purpose of their message being read from such main traveled way, shall, pursuant to this section, be limited to (1) directional and official signs and notices, which signs and notices shall include, but not be limited to, signs and notices pertaining to natural wonders, scenic and historical attractions, which are required or authorized by law, which shall conform to national standards hereby authorized to be promulgated by the Secretary hereunder, which standards shall contain provisions concerning lighting, size, number, and spacing of signs, and such other requirements as may be appropriate to implement this section, (2) signs, displays, and devices advertising the sale or lease of property upon which they are located, (3) signs, displays, and devices, including those which may be changed at reasonable intervals by electronic process or by remote control, advertising activities conducted on the property on which they are located, (4) signs lawfully in existence on October 22, 1965, determined by the State subject to the approval of the Secretary, to be landmark signs, including signs on farm structures or natural surfaces, or historic or artistic significance the preservation of which would be consistent with the purposes of this section, and (5) signs, displays, and devices advertising the distribution by nonprofit organizations of free coffee to individuals traveling on the Interstate System or the primary system.
For the purposes of this subsection, the term “free coffee” shall include coffee for which a donation may be made, but is not required.

(d) In order to promote the reasonable, orderly and effective display of outdoor advertising while remaining consistent with the purposes of this section, signs, displays, and devices whose size, lighting and spacing, consistent with customary use is to be determined by agreement between the several States and the Secretary, may be erected and maintained within six hundred and sixty feet of the nearest edge of the right-of-way within areas adjacent to the Interstate and primary systems which are zoned industrial or commercial under authority of State law, or in unzoned commercial or industrial areas as may be determined by agreement between the several States and the Secretary.
The States shall have full authority under their own zoning laws to zone areas for commercial or industrial purposes, and the actions of the States in this regard will be accepted for the purposes of this Act.
Whenever a bona fide State, county, or local zoning authority has made a determination of customary use, such determination will be accepted in lieu of controls by agreement in the zoned commercial and industrial areas within the geographical jurisdiction of such authority.
Nothing in this subsection shall apply to signs, displays, and devices referred to in clauses (2) and (3) of subsection (c) of this section.

(e) Any sign, display, or device lawfully in existence along the Interstate System or the Federal-aid primary system on September 1, 1965, which does not conform to this section shall not be required to be removed until July 1, 1970. Any other sign, display, or device lawfully erected which does not conform to this section shall not be required to be removed until the end of the fifth year after it becomes nonconforming.

(f) The Secretary shall, in consultation with the States, provide within the rights-of-way for areas at appropriate distances from interchanges on the Interstate System, on which signs, displays, and devices giving specific information in the interest of the traveling public may be erected and maintained.
The Secretary may also, in consultation with the States, provide within the rights-of-way of the primary system for areas in which signs, displays, and devices giving specific information in the interest of the traveling public may be erected and maintained.
Such signs shall conform to national standards to be promulgated by the Secretary.

(g) Just compensation shall be paid upon the removal of any outdoor advertising sign, display, or device lawfully erected under State law and not permitted under subsection (c) of this section, whether or not removed pursuant to or because of this section.
The Federal share of such compensation shall be 75 per centum.

(B) The taking from the owner of the real property on which the sign, display, or device is located, of the right to erect and maintain such signs, displays, and devices thereon.

(h) All public lands or reservations of the United States which are adjacent to any portion of the Interstate System and the primary system shall be controlled in accordance with the provisions of this section and the national standards promulgated by the Secretary.

(i) In order to provide information in the specific interest of the traveling public, the State highway departments are authorized to maintain maps and to permit information directories and advertising pamphlets to be made available at safety rest areas.
Subject to the approval of the Secretary, a State may also establish information centers at safety rest areas and other travel information systems within the rights-of-way for the purpose of informing the public of places of interest within the State and providing such other information as a State may consider desirable.
The Federal share of the cost of establishing such an information center or travel information system shall be that which is provided in section 120 for a highway project on that Federal-aid system to be served by such center or system.

(j) Any State highway department which has, under this section as in effect on June 30, 1965, entered into an agreement with the Secretary to control the erection and maintenance of outdoor advertising signs, displays, and devices in areas adjacent to the Interstate System shall be entitled to receive the bonus payments as set forth in the agreement, but no such State highway department shall be entitled to such payments unless the State maintains the control required under such agreement: Provided, That permission by a State to erect and maintain information displays which may be changed at reasonable intervals by electronic process or remote control and which provide public service information or advertise activities conducted on the property on which they are located shall not be considered a breach of such agreement or the control required thereunder.
Such payments shall be paid only from appropriations made to carry out this section.
The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to exempt any State from controlling outdoor advertising as otherwise provided in this section.

(k) Subject to compliance with subsection (g) of this section for the payment of just compensation, nothing in this section shall prohibit a State from establishing standards imposing stricter limitations with respect to signs, displays, and devices on the Federal-aid highway systems than those established under this section.

(l) Not less than sixty days before making a final determination to withhold funds from a State under subsection (b) of this section, or to do so under subsection (b) of section 136, or with respect to failing to agree as to the size, lighting, and spacing of signs, displays, and devices or as to unzoned commercial or industrial areas in which signs, displays, and devices may be erected and maintained under subsection (d) of this section, or with respect to failure to approve under subsection (g) of section 136, the Secretary shall give written notice to the State of his proposed determination and a statement of the reasons therefor, and during such period shall give the State an opportunity for a hearing on such determination.
Following such hearing the Secretary shall issue a written order setting forth his final determination and shall furnish a copy of such order to the State.
Within forty-five days of receipt of such order, the State may appeal such order to any United States district court for such State, and upon the filing of such appeal such order shall be stayed until final judgment has been entered on such appeal.
Summons may be served at any place in the United States.
The court shall have jurisdiction to affirm the determination of the Secretary or to set it aside, in whole or in part.
The judgment of the court shall be subject to review by the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which the State is located and to the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification as provided in title 28, United States Code, section 1254. If any part of an apportionment to a State is withheld by the Secretary under subsection (b) of this section or subsection (b) of section 136, the amount so withheld shall not be reapportioned to the other States as long as a suit brought by such State under this subsection is pending.
Such amount shall remain available for apportionment in accordance with the final judgment and this subsection.
Funds withheld from apportionment and subsequently apportioned or reapportioned under this section shall be available for expenditure for three full fiscal years after the date of such apportionment or reapportionment as the case may be.

(m) There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out the provisions of this section, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, not to exceed $20,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1966, not to exceed $20,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1967, not to exceed $2,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1970, not to exceed $27,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1971, not to exceed $20,500,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1972, and not to exceed $50,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1973.

Subject to approval by the Secretary in accordance with the program of projects approval process of section 105, a State may use any funds apportioned to it under section 104 of this title for removal of any sign, display, or device lawfully erected which does not conform to this section.

(n) No sign, display, or device shall be required to be removed under this section if the Federal share of the just compensation to be paid upon removal of such sign, display, or device is not available to make such payment.
Funds apportioned to a State under section 104 of this title shall not be treated for purposes of the preceding sentence as being available to the State for making such a payment except to the extent that the State, in its discretion, expends such funds for such a payment.

(o) The Secretary may approve the request of a State to permit retention in specific areas defined by such State of directional signs, displays, and devices lawfully erected under State law in force at the time of their erection which do not conform to the requirements of subsection (c), where such signs, displays, and devices are in existence on the date of enactment of this subsection and where the State demonstrates that such signs, displays, and devices (1) provide directional information about goods and services in the interest of the traveling public, and (2) are such that removal would work a substantial economic hardship in such defined area.

(p) In the case of any sign, display, or device required to be removed under this section prior to the date of enactment of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1974, which sign, display, or device was after its removal lawfully relocated and which as a result of the amendments made to this section by such Act is required to be removed, the United States shall pay 100 per centum of the just compensation for such removal (including all relocation costs).

(q)(1) During the implementation of State laws enacted to comply with this section, the Secretary shall encourage and assist the States to develop sign controls and programs which will assure that necessary directional information about facilities providing goods and services in the interest of the traveling public will continue to be available to motorists.
To this end the Secretary shall restudy and revise as appropriate existing standards for directional signs authorized under subsections 131(c)(1) and 131(f) to develop signs which are functional and esthetically compatible with their surroundings.
He shall employ the resources of other Federal departments and agencies, including the National Endowment for the Arts, and employ maximum participation of private industry in the development of standards and systems of signs developed for those purposes.

(2) Among other things the Secretary shall encourage States to adopt programs to assure that removal of signs providing necessary directional information, which also were providing directional information on June 1, 1972, about facilities in the interest of the traveling public, be deferred until all other nonconforming signs are removed.

(r) Removal of Illegal Signs.—

(1) By owners.—Any sign, display, or device along the Interstate System or the Federal-aid primary system which was not lawfully erected, shall be removed by the owner of such sign, display, or device not later than the 90th day following the effective date of this subsection.

(2) By states.—If any owner does not remove a sign, display, or device in accordance with paragraph (1), the State within the borders of which the sign, display, or device is located shall remove the sign, display, or device.
The owner of the removed sign, display, or device shall be liable to the State for the costs of such removal.
Effective control under this section includes compliance with the first sentence of this paragraph.

(s) Scenic Byway Prohibition.—If a State has a scenic byway program, the State may not allow the erection along any highway on the Interstate System or Federal-aid primary system which before, on, or after the effective date of this subsection, is designated as a scenic byway under such program of any sign, display, or device which is not in conformance with subsection (c) of this section.
Control of any sign, display, or device on such a highway shall be in accordance with this section.
In designating a scenic byway for purposes of this section and section 1047 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, a State may exclude from such designation any segment of a highway that is inconsistent with the State's criteria for designating State scenic byways.
Nothing in the preceding sentence shall preclude a State from signing any such excluded segment, including such segment on a map, or carrying out similar activities, solely for purposes of system continuity.

(t) Primary System Defined.—For purposes of this section, the terms “primary system” and “Federal-aid primary system” mean the Federal-aid primary system in existence on June 1, 1991, and any highway which is not on such system but which is on the National Highway System.

§134. Metropolitan planning

(a) General Requirements.—It is in the national interest to encourage and promote the development of transportation systems embracing various modes of transportation in a manner which will efficiently maximize mobility of people and goods within and through urbanized areas and minimize transportation-related fuel consumption and air pollution.
To accomplish this objective, metropolitan planning organizations, in cooperation with the State, shall develop transportation plans and programs for urbanized areas of the State.
Such plans and programs shall provide for the development of transportation facilities (including pedestrian walkways and bicycle transportation facilities) which will function as an intermodal transportation system for the State, the metropolitan areas, and the Nation.
The process for developing such plans and programs shall provide for consideration of all modes of transportation and shall be continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive to the degree appropriate, based on the complexity of the transportation problems.

(b) Designation of Metropolitan Planning Organizations.—

(1) In general.—To carry out the transportation planning process required by this section, a metropolitan planning organization shall be designated for each urbanized area of more than 50,000 population by agreement among the Governor and units of general purpose local government which together represent at least 75 percent of the affected population (including the central city or cities as defined by the Bureau of the Census) or in accordance with procedures established by applicable State or local law.

(2) Membership of certain mpo's.—In a metropolitan area designated as a transportation management area, the metropolitan planning organization designated for such area shall include local elected officials, officials of agencies which administer or operate major modes of transportation in the metropolitan area (including all transportation agencies included in the metropolitan planning organization on June 1, 1991) and appropriate State officials.
This paragraph shall only apply to a metropolitan planning organization which is redesignated after the date of the enactment of this section.

(3) Limitation on statutory construction.—Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to interfere with the authority, under any State law in effect on the date of the enactment of this section, of a public agency with multimodal transportation responsibilities to—

(A) develop plans and programs for adoption by a metropolitan planning organization; and

(B) develop long-range capital plans, coordinate transit services and projects, and carry out other activities pursuant to State law.

(4) Continuing designation.—Designations of metropolitan planning organizations, whether made under this section or other provisions of law, shall remain in effect until redesignated under paragraph (5) or revoked by agreement among the Governor and units of general purpose local government which together represent at least 75 percent of the affected population or as otherwise provided under State or local procedures.

(5) Redesignation.—

(A) Procedures.—A metropolitan planning organization may be redesignated by agreement among the Governor and units of general purpose local government which together represent at least 75 percent of the affected population (including the central city or cities as defined by the Bureau of the Census) as appropriate to carry out this section.

(B) Certain requests to redesignate.—A metropolitan planning organization shall be redesignated upon request of a unit or units of general purpose local government representing at least 25 percent of the affected population (including the central city or cities as defined by the Bureau of the Census) in any urbanized area (i) whose population is more than 5,000,000 but less than 10,000,000, or (ii) which is an extreme nonattainment area for ozone or carbon monoxide as defined under the Clean Air Act.
Such redesignation shall be accomplished using procedures established by subparagraph (A).

(6) Treatment of large urban areas.—More than 1 metropolitan planning organization may be designated within an urbanized area as defined by the Bureau of the Census only if the Governor determines that the size and complexity of the urbanized area make designation of more than 1 metropolitan planning organization for such area appropriate.

(c) Metropolitan Area Boundaries.—For the purposes of this section, the boundaries of a metropolitan area shall be determined by agreement between the metropolitan planning organization and the Governor.
Each metropolitan area shall cover at least the existing urbanized area and the contiguous area expected to become urbanized within the 20-year forecast period and may encompass the entire metropolitan statistical area or consolidated metropolitan statistical area, as defined by the Bureau of the Census.
For areas designated as nonattainment areas for ozone or carbon monoxide under the Clean Air Act, the boundaries of the metropolitan area shall at least include the boundaries of the nonattainment area, except as otherwise provided by agreement between the metropolitan planning organization and the Governor.

(d) Coordination in Multistate Areas.—

(1) In general.—The Secretary shall establish such requirements as the Secretary considers appropriate to encourage Governors and metropolitan planning organizations with responsibility for a portion of a multi-State metropolitan area to provide coordinated transportation planning for the entire metropolitan area.

(2) Compacts.—The consent of Congress is hereby given to any 2 or more States to enter into agreements or compacts, not in conflict with any law of the United States, for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in support of activities authorized under this section as such activities pertain to interstate areas and localities within such States and to establish such agencies, joint or otherwise, as such States may deem desirable for making such agreements and compacts effective.

(e) Coordination of MPO’s.—If more than 1 metropolitan planning organization has authority within a metropolitan area or an area which is designated as a nonattainment area for ozone or carbon monoxide under the Clean Air Act, each metropolitan planning organization shall consult with the other metropolitan planning organizations designated for such area and the State in the coordination of plans and programs required by this section.

(f) Factors To Be Considered.—In developing transportation plans and programs pursuant to this section, each metropolitan planning organization shall, at a minimum, consider the following:

(1) Preservation of existing transportation facilities and, where practical, ways to meet transportation needs by using existing transportation facilities more efficiently.

(2) The consistency of transportation planning with applicable Federal, State, and local energy conservation programs, goals, and objectives.

(3) The need to relieve congestion and prevent congestion from occurring where it does not yet occur.

(4) The likely effect of transportation policy decisions on land use and development and the consistency of transportation plans and programs with the provisions of all applicable short- and long-term land use and development plans.

(5) The programming of expenditure on transportation enhancement activities as required in section 133.

(6) The effects of all transportation projects to be undertaken within the metropolitan area, without regard to whether such projects are publicly funded.

(7) International border crossings and access to ports, airports, intermodal transportation facilities, major freight distribution routes, national parks, recreation areas, monuments and historic sites, and military installations.

(8) The need for connectivity of roads within the metropolitan area with roads outside the metropolitan area.

(9) The transportation needs identified through use of the management systems required by section 303 of this title.

(10) Preservation of rights-of-way for construction of future transportation projects, including identification of unused rights-of-way which may be needed for future transportation corridors and identification of those corridors for which action is most needed to prevent destruction or loss.

(11) Methods to enhance the efficient movement of freight.

(12) The use of life-cycle costs in the design and engineering of bridges, tunnels, or pavement.

(13) The overall social, economic, energy, and environmental effects of transportation decisions.

The mileage of any highway designated as part of the Interstate System under this section shall not be charged against the limitation established by the first sentence of section 103(e) of this title.
The designation of a highway as part of the Interstate System under this subsection shall create no Federal financial responsibility with respect to such highway; except that any State may use funds available to it under sections 104(b)(1) and 104(b)(5)(B) of this title for the resurfacing, restoring, rehabilitating, and reconstructing of any highway designated as a route on the Interstate System under this subsection before the date of enactment of this sentence.

(b) Whenever the Secretary determines that a highway on the Federal-aid primary system would be a logical addition or connection to the Interstate System and would qualify for designation as a route on that system in the same manner as set forth in paragraph 1 of subsection (e) of section 103 of this title, he may upon the affirmative recommendation of the State or States involved designate such highway as a future part of the Interstate System.
Such designation shall be made only upon the written agreement of the State or States involved that such highway will be constructed to meet all the standards of a highway on the Interstate System within twelve years of the date of the agreement between the Secretary and the State or States involved.
The mileage of any highway designated as a future part of the Interstate System under this subsection shall not be charged against the limitations established by the first sentence of section 103(e) of this title.
The designation of a highway as part of the Interstate System under this subsection shall create no Federal financial responsibility with respect to such highway; except that any State may use funds available to it under sections 104(b)(1) and 104(b)(5)(B) of this title for the resurfacing, restoring, rehabilitating, and reconstructing of any highway designated as a route on the Interstate System under this subsection before the date of enactment of this sentence.
In the event that the State or States involved have not substantially completed the construction of any highway designated under this subsection within the time provided for in the agreement between the Secretary and State or States involved, the Secretary shall remove the designation of such highway as a future part of the Interstate System.
Removal of such designation as result of failure to comply with the agreement provided for in this subsection shall in no way prohibit the Secretary from designating such route as part of the Interstate System pursuant to subsection (a) of this section or under any other provision of law providing for addition to the Interstate System.
No law, rule, regulation, map, document, or other record of the United States, or of any State or political subdivision thereof, shall refer to any highway under this section, nor shall any such highway be signed or marked, as a highway on the Interstate System until such time as such highway is constructed to the geometric and construction standards for the Interstate System and has been designated as a part of the Interstate System.

(c) The Secretary shall designate those portions of highway segments on the Federal-aid primary system in States which have no Interstate System that are logical components to a system serving the State's principal cities, national defense needs and military installations, and traffic generated by rail, water, and air transportation modes.
The designated segments shall have been constructed to the geometric and construction standards adequate for current and probable future traffic demands and the needs of the locality of the segment.
The mileage of any highway designated as part of the Interstate System under this subsection shall not be charged against the limitation established by the first sentence of section 103(e)(1) of this title.
The designation of a highway under this subsection shall create no Federal financial responsibility with respect to such highway, except that the State involved may use Federal-aid highway funds available to it under sections 104(b)(1) and 104(b)(5)(B) of this title, for the resurfacing, rehabilitation, restoration, and reconstruction of a highway designated as a route on the Interstate System under this subsection.

§144. Highway bridge replacement and rehabilitation program

(a) Congress hereby finds and declares it to be in the vital interest of the Nation that a highway bridge replacement and rehabilitation program be established to enable the several States to replace or rehabilitate highway bridges over waterways, other topographical barriers, other highways, or railroads when the States and the Secretary finds that a bridge is significantly important and is unsafe because of structural deficiencies, physical deterioration, or functional obsolescence.

(b) The Secretary, in consultation with the States, shall (1) inventory all those highway bridges on any Federal-aid system which are bridges over waterways, other topographical barriers, other highways, and railroads; (2) classify them according to serviceability, safety, and essentiality for public use; (3) based on that classification, assign each a priority for replacement or rehabilitation; and (4) determine the cost of replacing each such bridge with a comparable facility or of rehabilitating such bridge.

(c)(1) The Secretary, in consultation with the States, shall (1) inventory all those highway bridges on public roads, other than those on any Federal-aid system, which are bridges over waterways, other topographical barriers, other highways, and railroads, (2) classify them according to serviceability, safety, and essentiality for public use, (3) based on the classification, assign each a priority for replacement or rehabilitation and (4) determine the cost of replacing each such bridge with a comparable facility or of rehabilitating such bridge.

(2) The Secretary may, at the request of a State, inventory bridges, on and off the Federal-aid system, for historic significance.

(3) Inventory of indian reservation and park bridges.—As part of the activities carried out under paragraph (1), the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, shall (A) inventory all those highway bridges on Indian reservation roads and park roads which are bridges over waterways, other topographical barriers, other highways, and railroads, (B) classify them according to serviceability, safety, and essentiality for public use, (C) based on the classification, assign each a priority for replacement or rehabilitation, and (D) determine the cost of replacing each such bridge with a comparable facility or of rehabilitating such bridge.

(d) Whenever any State or States make application to the Secretary for assistance in replacing or rehabilitating a highway bridge which the priority system established under subsection (b) and (c) of this section shows to be eligible, the Secretary may approve Federal participation in replacing such bridge with a comparable facility or in rehabilitating such bridge.
Whenever any State makes application to the Secretary for assistance in painting and seismic retrofit, or applying calcium magnesium acetate to, the structure of a highway bridge, the Secretary may approve Federal participation in the painting or seismic retrofit of, or application of such acetate to, such structure.
The Secretary shall determine the eligibility of highway bridges for replacement or rehabilitation for each State based upon the unsafe highway bridges in such State, except that a State may carry out a project for seismic retrofit of a bridge under this section without regard to whether the bridge is eligible for replacement or rehabilitation under this section.
In approving projects (other than projects for bridge structure painting or seismic retrofit or application of such acetate) under this section, the Secretary shall give consideration to those projects which will remove from service those highway bridges most in danger of failure.

(e) Funds authorized to carry out this section shall be apportioned among the several States on October 1 of the fiscal year for which authorized in accordance with this subsection.
Each deficient bridge shall be placed into one of the following categories: (1) Federal-aid system bridges eligible for replacement, (2) Federal-aid system bridges eligible for rehabilitation, (3) off-system bridges eligible for replacement, and (4) off-system bridges eligible for rehabilitation.
The square footage of deficient bridges in each category shall be multiplied by the respective unit price on a State-by-State basis, as determined by the Secretary; and the total cost in each State divided by the total cost of the deficient bridges in all States shall determine the apportionment factors.
For purposes of the preceding sentence, the total cost of deficient bridges in a State and in all States shall be reduced by the total cost of any highway bridges constructed under subsection (m) in such State, relating to replacement of destroyed bridges and ferryboat services.
No State shall receive more than 10 per centum or less than 0.25 per centum of the total apportionment for any one fiscal year.
The Secretary shall make these determinations based upon the latest available data, which shall be updated annually.
Funds apportioned under this section shall be available for expenditure for the same period as funds apportioned for projects on the Federal-aid primary system under this title.
Any funds not obligated at the expiration of such period shall be reapportioned by the Secretary to the other States in accordance with this subsection.
The use of funds authorized under this section to carry out a project for the seismic retrofit of a bridge shall not affect the apportionment of funds under this section.

(f) The Federal share payable on account of any project under this section shall be 80 per centum of the cost thereof.

Surface Transportation Research and Development Planning

Section 6009 of title VI of Pub. L. 102–240, as amended by Pub. L. 104–59, title III, §338(c)(1), Nov. 28, 1995, 109 Stat. 604, provided that:

“(a) Findings.—Congress finds that—

“(1) despite an annual expenditure in excess of $10,000,000,000 on surface transportation and its infrastructure, the Federal Government has not developed a clear vision of—

“(A) how the surface transportation systems of the 21st century will differ from the present;

“(B) how they will interface with each other and with other forms of transportation;

“(C) how such systems will adjust to changing American population patterns and lifestyles; and

“(D) the role of federally funded research and development in ensuring that appropriate transportation systems are developed and implemented;

“(2) the population of the United States is projected to increase by over 30,000,000 people within the next 20 years, mostly in existing major metropolitan areas, which will result in increased traffic congestion within and between urban areas, more accidents, loss of productive time, and increased cost of transportation unless new technologies are developed to improve public transportation within cities and to move people and goods between cities;

“(3) 18,000,000 crashes, 4,000,000 injuries, and 45,000 fatalities each year on the Nation's highways are intolerable and substantial research is required in order to develop safer technologies in their most useful and economic forms;

“(4) current research and development funding for surface transportation is insufficient to provide the United States with the technologies essential to providing its own advanced transportation systems in the future and, as a result, the United States is becoming increasingly dependent on foreign surface transportation technologies and equipment to meet its expanding surface transportation needs;

“(5) a more active, focused surface transportation research and development program involving cooperation among the Federal Government, United States based industry, and United States universities should be organized on a priority basis;

“(6) intelligent transportation systems represent the best near-term technology for improving surface transportation for public benefit by providing equipment which can improve traffic flow and provide for enhanced safety;

“(7) research and development programs related to surface transportation are fragmented and dispersed throughout government and need to be strengthened and incorporated in an integrated framework within which a consensus on the goals of a national surface transportation research and development program must be developed;

“(8) the inability of government agencies to cooperate effectively, the difficulty of obtaining public support for new systems and rights-of-way, and the high cost of capital financing discourage private firms from investing in the development of new transportation equipment and systems; therefore, the Federal Government should sponsor and coordinate research and development of new technologies to provide safer, more convenient, and affordable transportation systems for use in the future; and

“(9) an effective high technology applied research and development program should be implemented quickly by strengthening the Department of Transportation research and development staff and by contracting with private industry for specific development projects.

The highway department of the State in which such dam shall be located, jointly with the Secretary, shall first determine and certify to such agency that such bridge is economically desirable and needed as a link in the State or Federal-aid highway systems, and shall request such agency to design and construct such dam so that it will serve as a suitable and adequate foundation for a public highway bridge and to design and construct such public highway bridge upon and across such dam, and shall agree to reimburse such agency pursuant to subsection (d) of this section for any additional costs which it may be required to incur because of the design and construction of such dam so that it will serve as a foundation for a public highway bridge and for expenditures which it may find it necessary to make in designing and constructing such public highway bridge upon and across such dam.
In no case shall the design and construction of a bridge upon and across such dam be undertaken hereunder except by the agency having jurisdiction over and custody of the dam, acting directly or through contractors employed by it, and after such agency shall determine that it will be structurally feasible and will not interfere with the proper functioning and operation of the dam.

(b) Construction of any bridge upon and across any dam pursuant to this section shall not be commenced unless and until the State in which such bridge is to be located, or the appropriate subdivision of such State, shall enter into an agreement with such agency and with the Secretary to construct, or cause to be constructed, with or without the aid of Federal funds, the approach roads necessary to connect such bridge with existing public highways and to maintain, or cause to be maintained, such approach roads from and after their completion.

Any such agency is hereby authorized to convey to the State, or to the appropriate subdivision thereof, without costs, such easements and rights-of-way in its custody or over lands of the United States in its custody and control as may be necessary, convenient, or proper for the location, construction, and maintenance of the approach roads referred to in this section including such roadside parks or recreational areas of limited size as may be deemed necessary for the accommodation of the traveling public.
Any bridge constructed pursuant to this section upon and across a dam in the custody and jurisdiction of any agency of the United States, including such portion thereof, if any, as may extend beyond the physical limits of the dam, shall constitute and remain a part of said dam and be maintained by the agency.
Any such agency may enter into any such contracts and agreements with the State or its subdivisions respecting public use of any bridge so located and constructed as may be deemed appropriate, but no such bridge shall be closed to public use by the agency except in cases of emergency or when deemed necessary in the interest of national security.

(c) All costs and expenses incurred and expenditures made by any agency in the exercise of the powers and authority conferred by this section (but not including any costs, expenses, or expenditures which would have been required in any event to satisfy a legal road or bridge relocation obligation or to meet operating or other agency needs) shall be recorded and kept separate and apart from the other costs, expenses, and expenditures of such agency, and no portion thereof shall be charged or allocated to flood control, navigation, irrigation, fertilizer production, the national defense, the development of power, or other program, purpose, or function of such agency.

Of each bridge constructed upon and across a dam under the provisions of this section, there may be financed wholly with Federal funds that portion thereof which is located within the physical limits of the masonry structure, or structures, of the dam, and the Secretary shall in his sole discretion determine what additional portion of the bridge, if any, may be so financed, such determination to be final and conclusive.
The remainder of the bridge, and any necessary related approach roads, shall be financed by the State or its appropriate subdivision with or without the aid of Federal funds; but said portion of the bridge so financed by the State or its subdivisions, including such portion thereof, if any, as may extend beyond the physical limits of the dam, shall nevertheless be designed and constructed solely by the agency having custody and jurisdiction of the dam as provided in subsection (a) of this section.

(e) In making, reviewing, or approving the design of any bridge or approach structure to be constructed under this section, the agency shall, in matters relating to roadway design, loadings, clearances and widths, and traffic safeguards, give full consideration to and be guided by the standards and advice of the Secretary.

(f) The authority conferred by this section shall be in addition to and not in limitation of authority conferred upon any agency by any other law, and nothing in this section contained shall affect or be deemed to relate to any bridge approach structure, or highway constructed or to be constructed by any such agency in furtherance of its lawful purposes and requirements or to satisfy a legal obligation incurred independently of this section.

Section Referred to in Other Sections

This section is referred to in sections 152, 153 of this title.

§402. Highway safety programs

(a) Each State shall have a highway safety program approved by the Secretary, designed to reduce traffic accidents and deaths, injuries, and property damage resulting therefrom.
Such programs shall be in accordance with uniform guidelines promulgated by the Secretary.
Such uniform guidelines shall be expressed in terms of performance criteria.
In addition, such uniform guidelines shall include programs (1) to reduce injuries and deaths resulting from motor vehicles being driven in excess of posted speed limits, (2) to encourage the proper use of occupant protection devices (including the use of safety belts and child restraint systems) by occupants of motor vehicles and to increase public awareness of the benefit of motor vehicles equipped with airbags, (3) to reduce deaths and injuries resulting from persons driving motor vehicles while impaired by alcohol or a controlled substance, (4) to reduce deaths and injuries resulting from accidents involving motor vehicles and motorcycles, (5) to reduce injuries and deaths resulting from accidents involving school buses, and (6) to improve law enforcement services in motor vehicle accident prevention, traffic supervision, and post-accident procedures.
The Secretary shall establish a highway safety program for the collection and reporting of data on traffic-related deaths and injuries by the States.
Under such program, the States shall collect and report such data as the Secretary may require.
The purposes of the program are to ensure national uniform data on such deaths and injuries and to allow the Secretary to make determinations for use in developing programs to reduce such deaths and injuries and making recommendations to Congress concerning legislation necessary to implement such programs.
The program shall include information obtained by the Secretary under section 4007 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 and provide for annual reports to the Secretary on the efforts being made by the States in reducing deaths and injuries occurring at highway construction sites and the effectiveness and results of such efforts.
The Secretary shall establish minimum reporting criteria for the program.
Such criteria shall include, but not be limited to, criteria on deaths and injuries resulting from police pursuits, school bus accidents, and speeding, on traffic-related deaths and injuries at highway construction sites and on the configuration of commercial motor vehicles involved in motor vehicle accidents.
Such uniform guidelines shall be promulgated by the Secretary so as to improve driver performance (including, but not limited to, driver education, driver testing to determine proficiency to operate motor vehicles, driver examinations (both physical and mental) and driver licensing) and to improve pedestrian performance and bicycle safety.
In addition such uniform guidelines shall include, but not be limited to, provisions for an effective record system of accidents (including injuries and deaths resulting therefrom), accident investigations to determine the probable causes of accidents, injuries, and deaths, vehicle registration, operation, and inspection, highway design and maintenance (including lighting, markings, and surface treatment), traffic control, vehicle codes and laws, surveillance of traffic for detection and correction of high or potentially high accident locations, and emergency services.
Such guidelines as are applicable to State highway safety programs shall, to the extent determined appropriate by the Secretary, be applicable to federally administered areas where a Federal department or agency controls the highways or supervises traffic operations.

(b)(1) The Secretary shall not approve any State highway safety program under this section which does not—

(A) provide that the Governor of the State shall be responsible for the administration of the program through a State highway safety agency which shall have adequate powers, and be suitably equipped and organized to carry out, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, such program.

(B) authorize political subdivisions of such State to carry out local highway safety programs within their jurisdictions as a part of the State highway safety program if such local highway safety programs are approved by the Governor and are in accordance with the uniform guidelines of the Secretary promulgated under this section.

(C) provide that at least 40 per centum of all Federal funds apportioned under this section to such State for any fiscal year will be expended by the political subdivisions of such State in carrying out local highway safety programs authorized in accordance with subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.

(D) provide adequate and reasonable access for the safe and convenient movement of physically handicapped persons, including those in wheelchairs, across curbs constructed or replaced on or after July 1, 1976, at all pedestrian crosswalks throughout the State.

(E) provide for programs (which may include financial incentives and disincentives) to encourage the use of safety belts by drivers of, and passengers in, motor vehicles.

(2) The Secretary is authorized to waive the requirement of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (1) of this subsection, in whole or in part, for a fiscal year for any State whenever he determines that there is an insufficient number of local highway safety programs to justify the expenditure in such State of such percentage of Federal funds during such fiscal year.

(3) Administrative requirements.—The Secretary may not approve a State highway safety program under this section which does not—

(A) provide that the Governor of the State shall be responsible for the administration of the program through a State highway safety agency which shall have adequate powers and be suitably equipped and organized to carry out, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, such program;

(B) authorize political subdivisions of the State to carry out local highway safety programs within their jurisdictions as a part of the State highway safety program if such local highway safety programs are approved by the Governor and are in accordance with the minimum standards established by the Secretary under this section;

(C) except as provided in paragraph (5), provide that at least 40 percent of all Federal funds apportioned under this section to the State for any fiscal year will be expended by the political subdivisions of the State, including Indian tribal governments, in carrying out local highway safety programs authorized in accordance with subparagraph (B); and

(D) provide adequate and reasonable access for the safe and convenient movement of individuals with disabilities, including those in wheelchairs, across curbs constructed or replaced on or after July 1, 1976, at all pedestrian crosswalks throughout the State.

(4) Waiver.—The Secretary may waive the requirement of paragraph (3)(C), in whole or in part, for a fiscal year for any State whenever the Secretary determines that there is an insufficient number of local highway safety programs to justify the expenditure in the State of such percentage of Federal funds during the fiscal year.

(5) Use of technology for traffic enforcement.—The Secretary may encourage States to use technologically advanced traffic enforcement devices (including the use of automatic speed detection devices such as photo-radar) by law enforcement officers.

(c) Funds authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section shall be used to aid the States to conduct the highway safety programs approved in accordance with subsection (a), including development and implementation of manpower training programs, and of demonstration programs that the Secretary determines will contribute directly to the reduction of accidents, and deaths and injuries resulting therefrom.
Such funds shall be subject to a deduction not to exceed 5 per centum for the necessary costs of administering the provisions of this section, and the remainder shall be apportioned among the several States.
Such funds shall be apportioned 75 per centum in the ratio which the population of each State bears to the total population of all the States, as shown by the latest available Federal census, and 25 per centum in the ratio which the public road mileage in each State bears to the total public road mileage in all States.
For the purposes of this subsection, a “public road” means any road under the jurisdiction of and maintained by a public authority and open to public travel.
Public road mileage as used in this subsection shall be determined as of the end of the calendar year preceding the year in which the funds are apportioned and shall be certified to by the Governor of the State and subject to approval by the Secretary.
The annual apportionment to each State shall not be less than one-half of 1 per centum of the total apportionment, except that the apportionments to the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands shall not be less than one-quarter of 1 per centum of the total apportionment.
The Secretary shall not apportion any funds under the subsection to any State which is not implementing a highway safety program approved by the secretary in accordance with this section.
For the purpose of the seventh sentence of this subsection, a highway safety program approved by the Secretary shall not include any requirement that a State implement such a program by adopting or enforcing any law, rule, or regulation based on a guideline promulgated by the Secretary under this section requiring any motorcycle operator eighteen years of age or older or passenger eighteen years of age or older to wear a safety helmet when operating or riding a motorcycle on the streets and highways of that State.
Implementation of a highway safety program under this section shall not be construed to require the Secretary to require compliance with every uniform guideline, or with every element of every uniform guideline, in every State.
Funds apportioned under this section to any State, that does not have a highway safety program approved by the Secretary or that is not implementing an approved program, shall be reduced by amounts equal to not less than 50 per centum of the amounts that would otherwise be apportioned to the State under this section, until such time as the Secretary approves such program or determines that the State is implementing an approved program, as appropriate.
The Secretary shall consider the gravity of the State's failure to have or implement an approved program in determining the amount of the reduction.
The Secretary shall promptly apportion to the State the funds withheld from its apportionment if he approves the State's highway safety program or determines that the State has begun implementing an approved program, as appropriate, prior to the end of the fiscal year for which the funds were withheld.
If the Secretary determines that the State did not correct its failure within such period, the Secretary shall reapportion the withheld funds to the other States in accordance with the formula specified in this subsection not later than 30 days after such determination.

(d) All provisions of chapter 1 of this title that are applicable to National Highway System highway funds other than provisions relating to the apportionment formula and provisions limiting the expenditure of such funds to the Federal-aid systems, shall apply to the highway safety funds authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section, except as determined by the Secretary to be inconsistent with this section, and except that the aggregate of all expenditures made during any fiscal year by a State and its political subdivisions (exclusive of Federal funds) for carrying out the State highway safety program (other than planning and administration) shall be available for the purpose of crediting such State during such fiscal year for the non-Federal share of the cost of any project under this section (other than one for planning or administration) without regard to whether such expenditures were actually made in connection with such project and except that, in the case of a local highway safety program carried out by an Indian tribe, if the Secretary is satisfied that an Indian tribe does not have sufficient funds available to meet the non-Federal share of the cost of such program, he may increase the Federal share of the cost thereof payable under this Act to the extent necessary.
In applying such provisions of chapter 1 in carrying out this section the term “State highway department” as used in such provisions shall mean the Governor of a State for the purposes of this section.

(e) Uniform guidelines promulgated by the Secretary to carry out this section shall be developed in cooperation with the States, their political subdivisions, appropriate Federal departments and agencies, and such other public and private organizations as the Secretary deems appropriate.

(f) The Secretary may make arrangements with other Federal departments and agencies for assistance in the preparation of uniform guidelines for the highway safety programs contemplated by subsection (a) and in the administration of such programs.
Such departments and agencies are directed to cooperate in such preparation and administration, on a reimbursable basis.

(g) Nothing in this section authorizes the appropriation or expenditure of funds for (1) highway construction, maintenance, or design (other than design of safety features of highways to be incorporated into guidelines) or (2) any purpose for which funds are authorized by section 403 of this title.

[(h) Repealed.

Special Parking Privileges for Handicapped Persons

Pub. L. 98–78, title III, §321, Aug. 15, 1983, 97 Stat. 473, provided that:

“(a) The Congress finds that—

“(1) in this Nation there exist millions of handicapped people with severe physical impairments including partial paralysis, limb amputation, chronic heart condition, emphysema, arthritis, rheumatism, and other debilitating conditions which greatly limit their personal mobility;

“(2) these people reside in each of the several States and have need and reason to travel from one State to another for business and recreational purposes;

“(3) each State maintains the right to establish and enforce its own code of regulations regarding the appropriate use of motor vehicles operating within its jurisdiction;

“(4) within a given State handicapped individuals are oftentimes granted special parking privileges to help offset the limitations imposed by their physical impairment;

“(5) these special parking privileges vary from State to State as do the methods and means of identifying vehicles used by disabled individuals, all of which serve to impede both the enforcement of special parking privileges and the handicapped individual's freedom to properly utilize such privileges;

“(6) there are many efforts currently underway to help alleviate these problems through public awareness and administrative change as encouraged by concerned individuals and national associations directly involved in matters relating to the issue of special parking privileges for disabled individuals; and

“(7) despite these efforts the fact remains that many States may need to give the matter legislative consideration to ensure a proper resolution of this issue, especially as it relates to law enforcement and placard responsibility.

“(b) The Congress encourages each of the several States working through the National Governors Conference to—

“(1) adopt the International Symbol of Access as the only recognized and adopted symbol to be used to identify vehicles carrying those citizens with acknowledged physical impairments;

“(2) grant to vehicles displaying this symbol the special parking privileges which a State may provide; and

“(3) permit the International Symbol of Access to appear either on a specialized license plate, or on a specialized placard placed in the vehicles so as to be clearly visible through the front windshield, or on both such places.

“(c) It is the sense of the Congress that agreements of reciprocity relating to the special parking privileges granted handicapped individuals should be developed and entered into by and between the several States so as to—

“(1) facilitate the free and unencumbered use between the several States, of the special parking privileges afforded those people with acknowledged handicapped conditions, without regard to the State of residence of the handicapped person utilizing such privilege;

“(2) improve the ease of law enforcement in each State of its special parking privileges and to facilitate the handling of violators; and

“(3) ensure that motor vehicles carrying individuals with acknowledged handicapped conditions be given fair and predictable treatment throughout the Nation.

“(d) As used in this section the term ‘State’ means the several States and the District of Columbia.

“(e) The Secretary of Transportation shall provide a copy of this section to the Governor of each State and the Mayor of the District of Columbia.”
